Decommissioning Review: A review that confirms the decision to terminate or decommission a system and assess the readiness for the safe decommissioning and disposal of system assets. The DR is normally held near the end of routine mission operations upon accomplishment of planned mission objectives. It may be advanced if some unplanned event gives rise to a need to prematurely terminate the mission, or delayed if operational life is extended to permit additional investigations.
Deliverable Data Item: Consists of technical data, such as requirements specifications, design documents, management data plans, and metrics reports, that have been identified as items to be delivered with an end product.
Demonstration: Showing that the use of an end product achieves the individual specified requirement (verification) or stakeholder expectation (validation). It is generally a basic confirmation of performance capability, differentiated from testing by the lack of detailed data gathering. Demonstrations can involve the use of physical models or mock-ups; for example, a requirement that all controls shall be reachable by the pilot could be verified by having a pilot perform flight-related tasks in a cockpit mock-up or simulator. A demonstration could also be the actual operation of the end product by highly qualified personnel, such as test pilots, who perform a one-time event that demonstrates a capability to operate at extreme limits of system performance.
Derived Requirements: Requirements arising from constraints, consideration of issues implied but not explicitly stated in the high-level direction provided by NASA Headquarters and Center institutional requirements, factors introduced by the selected architecture, and the design. These requirements are finalized through requirements analysis as part of the overall systems engineering process and become part of the program or project requirements baseline. Requirements arising from constraints, consideration of issues implied but not explicitly stated in the high-level direction provided by NASA Headquarters and Center institutional requirements, factors introduced by the selected architecture, and the design. These requirements are finalized through requirements analysis as part of the overall systems engineering process and become part of the program or project requirements baseline.

Enabling Products: The life cycle support products and services (e.g., production, test, deployment, training, maintenance, and disposal) that facilitate the progression and use of the operational end product through its life cycle. Since the end product and its enabling products are interdependent, they are viewed as a system. Project responsibility thus extends to acquiring services from the relevant enabling products in each life cycle phase. When a suitable enabling product does not already exist, the project that is responsible for the end product may also be responsible for creating and using the enabling product.
Engineering Unit: A high fidelity unit that demonstrates critical aspects of the engineering processes involved in the development of the operational unit. Engineering test units are intended to closely resemble the final product (hardware/software) to the maximum extent possible and are built and tested so as to establish confidence that the design will function in the expected environments. In some cases, the engineering unit will become the final product, assuming that proper traceability has been exercised over the components and hardware handling.

Product Realization: The desired output from the application of the four product realization processes. The form of this product is dependent on the phase of the product life cycle and the phase exit (success) criteria.
Prototype: The prototype unit demonstrates form, fit, and function at a scale deemed to be representative of the final product operating in its operational environment. A subscale test article provides fidelity sufficient to permit validation of analytical models capable of predicting the behavior of full-scale systems in an operational environment. The prototype is used to “wring out” the design solution so that experience gained from the prototype can be fed back into design changes that will improve the manufacture, integration, and maintainability of a single flight item or the production run of several flight items.
Quality Assurance: An independent assessment performed throughout a product’s life cycle in order to acquire confidence that the system actually produced and delivered is in accordance with its functional, performance, and design requirements.
Realized Product: The end product that has been implemented/integrated, verified, validated, and transitioned to the next product layer.
Recovery: An action taken to restore the functions necessary to achieve existing or redefined system goals after a fault/failure occurs.
Recursive: Value is added to the system by the repeated application of processes to design next lower-layer system products or to realize next upper-layer end products within the system structure. This also applies to repeating the application of the same processes to the system structure in the next life cycle phase to mature the system definition and satisfy phase exit (success) criteria.
Relevant Stakeholder: A subset of the term “stakeholder” that applies to people or roles that are designated in a plan for stakeholder involvement. Since “stakeholder” may describe a very large number of people, a lot of time and effort would be consumed by attempting to deal with all of them. For this reason, “relevant stakeholder” is used in most practice statements to describe the people identified to contribute to a specific task.
Relevant Environment: Not all systems, subsystems, and/or components need to be operated in the operational environment in order to satisfactorily address performance margin requirements or stakeholder expectations. Consequently, the relevant environment is the specific subset of the operational environment that is required to demonstrate critical “at risk” aspects of the final product performance in an operational environment.
Reliability: The measure of the degree to which a system ensures mission success by functioning properly over its intended life. It has a low and acceptable probability of failure, achieved through simplicity, proper design, and proper application of reliable parts and materials. In addition to long life, a reliable system is robust and fault tolerant.
Repeatable: A characteristic of a process that can be applied to products at any level of the system structure or within any life cycle phase.
Requirement: The agreed-upon need, desire, want, capability, capacity, or demand for personnel, equipment, facilities, or other resources or services by specified quantities for specific periods of time or at a specified time expressed as a “shall” statement. Acceptable form for a requirement statement is individually clear, correct, feasible to obtain, unambiguous in meaning, and can be validated at the level of the system structure at which it is stated. In pairs of requirement statements or as a set, collectively, they are not redundant, are adequately related with respect to terms used, and are not in conflict with one another.
Requirements Allocation Sheet: Documents the connection between allocated functions, allocated performance, and the physical system.
Requirements Management Process: A process used to manage the product requirements identified, baselined, and used in the definition of the products of each product layer during system design. It provides bidirectional traceability back to the top product layer requirements and manages the changes to established requirement baselines over the life cycle of the system products.
Risk: In the context of mission execution, risk is the potential for performance shortfalls that may be realized in the future with respect to achieving explicitly established and stated performance requirements. The performance shortfalls may be related to any one or more of the following mission execution domains: (1) safety, (2) technical, (3) cost, and (4) schedule. (Source: NPR 8000.4, Agency Risk Management Procedural Requirements)
Risk Assessment: An evaluation of a risk item that determines (1) what can go wrong, (2) how likely it is to occur, (3) what the consequences are, and (4) what the uncertainties associated with the likelihood and consequences are, and 5) what the mitigation plans are.
Risk-Informed Decision Analysis Process: A five-step process focusing first on objectives and next on developing decision alternatives with those objectives clearly in mind and/or using decision alternatives that have been developed under other systems engineering processes. The later steps of the process interrelate heavily with the Technical Risk Management Process.
Risk Management: Risk management includes Risk-Informed Decision-Making (RIDM) and Continuous Risk Management (CRM) in an integrated framework. RIDM informs systems engineering decisions through better use of risk and uncertainty information in selecting alternatives and establishing baseline requirements. CRM manages risks over the course of the development and the Implementation Phase of the life cycle to ensure that safety, technical, cost, and schedule requirements are met. This is done to foster proactive risk management, to better inform decision-making through better use of risk information, and then to more effectively manage Implementation risks by focusing the CRM process on the baseline performance requirements emerging from the RIDM process. (Source: NPR 8000.4, Agency Risk Management Procedural Requirements) These processes are applied at a level of rigor commensurate with the complexity, cost, and criticality of the program.
Safety: Freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment.
Search Space (or Alternative Space): The envelope of concept possibilities defined by design constraints and parameters within which alternative concepts can be developed and traded off.
Single-Project Programs: Programs that tend to have long development and/or operational lifetimes, represent a large investment of Agency resources, and have contributions from multiple organizations/agencies. These programs frequently combine program and project management approaches, which they document through tailoring.
Software: Computer programs, procedures, rules, and associated documentation and data pertaining to the development and operation of a computer system. Software also includes Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS), Modified Off-The-Shelf (MOTS), embedded software, reuse, heritage, legacy, autogenerated code, firmware, and open source software components.
Solicitation: The vehicle by which information is solicited from contractors for the purpose of awarding a contract for products or services. Any request to submit offers or quotations to the Government. Solicitations under sealed bid procedures are called “invitations for bids.” Solicitations under negotiated procedures are called “requests for proposals.” Solicitations under simplified acquisition procedures may require submission of either a quotation or an offer.
Specification: A document that prescribes completely, precisely, and verifiably the requirements, design, behavior, or characteristics of a system or system component. In NPR 7123.1, “specification” is treated as a “requirement.”
Stakeholder: A group or individual who is affected by or has an interest or stake in a program or project. There are two main classes of stakeholders. See “customers” and “other interested parties.”
Stakeholder Expectations: A statement of needs, desires, capabilities, and wants that are not expressed as a requirement (not expressed as a “shall” statement) is referred to as an “expectation.” Once the set of expectations from applicable stakeholders is collected, analyzed, and converted into a “shall” statement, the expectation becomes a requirement. Expectations can be stated in either qualitative (non-measurable) or quantitative (measurable) terms. Requirements are always stated in quantitative terms. Expectations can be stated in terms of functions, behaviors, or constraints with respect to the product being engineered or the process used to engineer the product.
Stakeholder Expectations Definition Process: A process used to elicit and define use cases, scenarios, concept of operations, and stakeholder expectations for the applicable product life cycle phases and product layer. The baselined stakeholder expectations are used for validation of the product layer end product.
Standing Review Board: The board responsible for conducting independent reviews (life-cycle and special) of a program or project and providing objective, expert judgments to the convening authorities. The reviews are conducted in accordance with approved Terms of Reference (ToR) and life cycle requirements per NPR 7123.1.
State Diagram: A diagram that shows the flow in the system in response to varying inputs in order to characterize the behavior of the system.
Success Criteria: Specific accomplishments that need to be satisfactorily demonstrated to meet the objectives of a technical review so that a technical effort can progress further in the life cycle. Success criteria are documented in the corresponding technical review plan. Formerly referred to as “exit” criteria, a term still used in some NPDs/NPRs.
Surveillance : The monitoring of a contractor’s activities (e.g., status meetings, reviews, audits, site visits) for progress and production and to demonstrate fiscal responsibility, ensure crew safety and mission success, and determine award fees for extraordinary (or penalty fees for substandard) contract execution.
System: (1) The combination of elements that function together to produce the capability to meet a need. The elements include all hardware, software, equipment, facilities, personnel, processes, and procedures needed for this purpose. (2) The end product (which performs operational functions) and enabling products (which provide life cycle support services to the operational end products) that make up a system.
System Acceptance Review: The SAR verifies the completeness of the specific end products in relation to their expected maturity level, assesses compliance to stakeholder expectations, and ensures that the system has sufficient technical maturity to authorize its shipment to the designated operational facility or launch site.
System Definition Review: The Mission/System Definition Review (MDR/SDR) evaluates whether the proposed mission/system architecture is responsive to the program mission/system functional and performance requirements and requirements have been allocated to all functional elements of the mission/system. This review is used for projects and for single-project programs.
System Integration Review: A SIR ensures that segments, components, and subsystems are on schedule to be integrated into the system and that integration facilities, support personnel, and integration plans and procedures are on schedule to support integration.
System Requirements Review: For a program, the SRR is used to ensure that its functional and performance requirements are properly formulated and correlated with the Agency and mission directorate strategic objectives. For a system/project, the SRR evaluates whether the functional and performance requirements defined for the system are responsive to the program’s requirements and ensures that the preliminary project plan and requirements will satisfy the mission.

Systems Approach: The application of a systematic, disciplined engineering approach that is quantifiable, recursive, iterative, and repeatable for the development, operation, and maintenance of systems integrated into a whole throughout the life cycle of a project or program.
Systems Engineering (SE) Engine: The SE model shown in Figure 2.1-1 that provides the 17 technical processes and their relationships with each other. The model is called an “SE engine” in that the appropriate set of processes is applied to the products being engineered to drive the technical effort.
Systems Engineering Management Plan (SEMP): The SEMP identifies the roles and responsibility interfaces of the technical effort and specifies how those interfaces will be managed. The SEMP is the vehicle that documents and communicates the technical approach, including the application of the common technical processes; resources to be used; and the key technical tasks, activities, and events along with their metrics and success criteria.
Tailoring: A process used to adjust or seek relief from a prescribed requirement to accommodate the needs of a specific task or activity (e.g., program or project). The tailoring process results in the generation of deviations and waivers depending on the timing of the request.
Technical Assessment Process: A process used to help monitor progress of the technical effort and provide status information for support of the system design, product realization, and technical management processes. A key aspect of the process is conducting life cycle and technical reviews throughout the system life cycle.
Technical Cost Estimate: The cost estimate of the technical work on a project created by the technical team based on its understanding of the system requirements and operational concepts and its vision of the system architecture.
Technical Data Management Process: A process used to plan for, acquire, access, manage, protect, and use data of a technical nature to support the total life cycle of a system. This process is used to capture trade studies, cost estimates, technical analyses, reports, and other important information.

Technical Measures: An established set of measures based on the expectations and requirements that will be tracked and assessed to determine overall system or product effectiveness and customer satisfaction. Common terms for these measures are Measures Of Effectiveness (MOEs), Measures Of Performance (MOPs), and Technical Performance Measures (TPMs).
Technical Performance Measures: A set of performance measures that are monitored by comparing the current actual achievement of the parameters with that anticipated at the current time and on future dates. TPMs are used to confirm progress and identify deficiencies that might jeopardize meeting a system requirement. Assessed parameter values that fall outside an expected range around the anticipated values indicate a need for evaluation and corrective action. Technical performance measures are typically selected from the defined set of Measures Of Performance (MOPs).
Technical Planning Process: A process used to plan for the application and management of each common technical process. It is also used to identify, define, and plan the technical effort applicable to the product life cycle phase for product layer location within the system structure and to meet project objectives and product life cycle phase exit (success) criteria. A key document generated by this process is the SEMP.
Technical Requirements: A set of requirements imposed on the end products of the system, including the system itself. Also referred to as “product requirements.”
Technical Requirements Definition Process: A process used to transform the stakeholder expectations into a complete set of validated technical requirements expressed as “shall” statements that can be used for defining a design solution for the Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) model and related enabling products.
Technical Risk: Risk associated with the achievement of a technical goal, criterion, or objective. It applies to undesired consequences related to technical performance, human safety, mission assets, or environment.
Technical Risk Management Process: A process used to make risk-informed decisions and examine, on a continuing basis, the potential for deviations from the project plan and the consequences that could result should they occur.
Technical Team: A group of multidisciplinary individuals with appropriate domain knowledge, experience, competencies, and skills who are assigned to a specific technical task.
Technology Readiness Assessment Report: A document required for transition from Phase B to Phase C/D demonstrating that all systems, subsystems, and components have achieved a level of technological maturity with demonstrated evidence of qualification in a relevant environment.
Technology Assessment: A systematic process that ascertains the need to develop or infuse technological advances into a system. The technology assessment process makes use of basic systems engineering principles and processes within the framework of the Product Breakdown Structure (PBS). It is a two-step process comprised of (1) the determination of the current technological maturity in terms of Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) and (2) the determination of the difficulty associated with moving a technology from one TRL to the next through the use of the Advancement Degree of Difficulty Assessment (AD2).
Technology Development Plan: A document required for transition from Phase A to Phase B identifying technologies to be developed, heritage systems to be modified, alternative paths to be pursued, fallback positions and corresponding performance descopes, milestones, metrics, and key decision points. It is incorporated in the preliminary project plan.
Technology Maturity Assessment: A process to determine a system’s technological maturity based on Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).
Technology Readiness Level: Provides a scale against which to measure the maturity of a technology. TRLs range from 1, basic technology research, to 9, systems test, launch, and operations. Typically, a TRL of 6 (i.e., technology demonstrated in a relevant environment) is required for a technology to be integrated into an SE process.
Test: The use of a realized end product to obtain detailed data to verify or validate performance or to provide sufficient information to verify or validate performance through further analysis.
Test Readiness Review: A review that ensures that the test article (hardware/software), test facility, support personnel, and test procedures are ready for testing and data acquisition, reduction, and control.
Threshold Requirements: A minimum acceptable set of technical and project requirements; the set could represent the descope position of the project.
Tightly Coupled Programs: Programs with multiple projects that execute portions of a mission(s). No single project is capable of implementing a complete mission. Typically, multiple NASA Centers contribute to the program. Individual projects may be managed at different Centers. The program may also include contributions from other agencies or international partners.
Traceability: A discernible association among two or more logical entities such as requirements, system elements, verifications, or tasks.
Trade Study: A means of evaluating system designs by devising alternative means to meet functional requirements, evaluating these alternatives in terms of the measures of effectiveness and system cost, ranking the alternatives according to appropriate selection criteria, dropping less promising alternatives, and proceeding to the next level of resolution, if needed.
Trade Study Report: A report written to document a trade study. It should include: the system under analysis; system goals, objectives (or requirements, as appropriate to the level of resolution), and constraints; measures and measurement methods (models) used; all data sources used; the alternatives chosen for analysis; computational results, including uncertainty ranges and sensitivity analyses performed; the selection rule used; and the recommended alternative.
Trade Tree: A representation of trade study alternatives in which each layer represents some system aspect that needs to be treated in a trade study to determine the best alternative.
Transition: The act of delivery or moving of a product from one location to another. This act can include packaging, handling, storing, moving, transporting, installing, and sustainment activities.
Uncoupled Programs: Programs implemented under a broad theme and/or a common program implementation concept, such as providing frequent flight opportunities for cost-capped projects selected through AO or NASA Research Announcements. Each such project is independent of the other projects within the program.
Utility: A measure of the relative value gained from an alternative. The theoretical unit of measurement for utility is the “util.”
Validated Requirements: A set of requirements that are well formed (clear and unambiguous), complete (agree with customer and stakeholder needs and expectations), consistent (conflict free), and individually verifiable and traceable to a higher level requirement or goal.
Validation (of a product): The process of showing proof that the product accomplishes the intended purpose based on stakeholder expectations and the Concept of Operations. May be determined by a combination of test, analysis, demonstration, and inspection. (Answers the question, “Am I building the right product?”)
Variance: In program control terminology, a difference between actual performance and planned costs or schedule status.
Verification (of a product): Proof of compliance with specifications. Verification may be determined by test, analysis, demonstration, or inspection or a combination thereof. (Answers the question, “Did I build the product right?”)
Waiver: A documented authorization releasing a program or project from meeting a requirement after the requirement is put under configuration control at the level the requirement will be implemented.
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): A product-oriented hierarchical division of the hardware, software, services, and data required to produce the program/ project’s end product(s) structured according to the way the work will be performed, reflecting the way in which program/project costs, schedule, technical, and risk data are to be accumulated, summarized, and reported.
WBS Model: A WBS model describes a system that consists of end products and their subsystems (which perform the operational functions of the system), the supporting or enabling products, and any other work products (plans, baselines) required for the development of the system.
Workflow Diagram: A scheduling chart that shows activities, dependencies among activities, and milestones.
