Frequently , we can do a feasibility assessment simply by comparison with existing systems . $$ 
Lidar missions are based on optical observations , even though they have to generate the optical signal whose reflection is observed . $$ 
This section describes any end to end testing that the system may undergo . $$ 
It can point to other stand alone descriptions of these tests if they will be generated as part of organizational responsibilities for the products at each product layer . $$ 
End of life burns are becoming a common removal mechanism for controllable objects in orbit , such as the controlled reentry over the Pacific Ocean of the Russian Mir space station . $$ 
It is not possible to make much more progress on mission design until an orbit can be picked for observations , and the observatory scoped to be compatible with both the environment of that orbit and the capabilities of an affordable launch vehicle to reach the orbit . $$ 
Each requirement will be addressed as compliant , partially compliant , or noncompliant . $$ 
Where is the fire and which way is it going ? $$ 
There are two main classes of stakeholders . $$ 
Don t mix operation with requirements : update the ConOps instead . $$ 
Are the tolerances defendable and cost effective ? $$ {"endOffset":19,"startOffset":8,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Are the key terms included in the project s glossary ? $$ 
Runtime : Verification of products during flight operations may be significantly time constrained . $$ 
In the subsections that follow , define structural limiting values at the interface , such as interface loads , forcing functions , and dynamic conditions . $$ 
Similarly , communications systems follow a very well defined link budget , that can determine with good precision , just how fast we will be able to get data back from Jupiter , given the power , wavelength or frequency , and the diameter of the antennas on the ground and on the spacecraft . $$ 
Thus , optical system design tools , and their equivalents for other spectral ranges , are a logical place to start . $$ 
Using the PBS as a framework has a twofold benefit it breaks the problem down into systems , subsystems , and components that can be more accurately assessed ; and it provides the results of the assessment in a format that can be readily used in the generation of program costs and schedules . $$ {"endOffset":14,"startOffset":10,"label":"Organization"}
Similarly , convection does not occur in space and heated materials do not churn or boil . $$ 
Microgravity leads to a wide variety of chemical and manufacturing processes that can not occur on the surface of the Earth . $$ {"endOffset":124,"startOffset":118,"label":"Organization"}
The first is to clearly identify each area s system drivers by the methods in Sec . $$ 
For many people , human spaceflight is the space program . $$ 
A lesson to be gained from these quotations is that total project or mission cost is a multifactorial problem with relative weightings that are different with commercial and government projects . $$ 
Define the interface requirements on each side of the interface plane . $$ {"endOffset":69,"startOffset":54,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Describes the philosophy of how which of the verification validation activities will be performed on each of the operational units as they are manufactured coded and are readied for flight use . $$ 
A mission need is a single statement that drives everything else . $$ 
Procurement plans for space systems too often substitute detailed numerical requirements for broad mission objectives . $$ 
There will always be some development to match the application to its environment and operational scenario . $$ {"endOffset":106,"startOffset":86,"label":"Features"}
It demonstrates that the mission is feasible , and it can be used as a baseline for comparison of alternatives . $$ 
Because settling does not occur , very large crystals can be formed in space which have a variety of industrial applications . $$ {"endOffset":124,"startOffset":101,"label":"Operation Concepts"}

When this can be done , trades between attributes can be assessed quantitatively . $$ {"endOffset":81,"startOffset":66,"label":"Numerical"},{"endOffset":49,"startOffset":39,"label":"Features"}
To develop a useful and complete set of scenarios , important malfunctions and degraded mode operational situations must be considered . $$ 
The cost of debris mitigation of a commercial satellite is incurred up front even though the mitigation takes place at the end of the satellite lifetime and the satellite operating corporation assumes some liability ever after the satellite s primary mission has ended . $$ 
That person or organization that crosses boundaries can serve both to bring the various communities closer together and to recognize the potential of using the technologies , processes , and methods from one area to benefit another . $$ {"endOffset":185,"startOffset":175,"label":"Features"},{"endOffset":199,"startOffset":191,"label":"Features"}
Hence , the area swept out per unit time is proportional to the angular momentum per unit mass which is a constant . $$ {"endOffset":81,"startOffset":72,"label":"Features"}
As seen in Fig . $$ {"endOffset":15,"startOffset":11,"label":"Artifact "}
In selecting the approach , the mission and system context should be kept in mind and the complexity of the decision analysis should fit the complexity of the mission , system , and corresponding decision . $$ 
Some programs have repeated operations flights which require configuration changes and new mission objectives with each occurrence . $$ 
This by no means represents all of the formal reviews for a major program . $$ 
Neither the warfighter on the ground nor the driver in their car trying to figure out which way to turn needs to know anything at all about that remarkable array of atomic clocks and software at half geosynchronous altitude , called the Global Positioning System , that can tell you where you are anywhere on the surface of the Earth to within a few meters . $$ 
The performance shortfalls may be related to any one or more of the following mission execution domains : safety , 2 technical , 3 cost , and 4 schedule . $$ 
In this case , the V \u0026 V Plan would be filled out as much as possible before . $$ 
Many other spacecraft operators have similar practices . $$ 
Another example occurs when the initial processing of either spacecraft bus or payload sensors may well be an interrupt driven activity in which the computer is spending most of its time servicing interrupts to bring in observation data . $$ {"endOffset":126,"startOffset":110,"label":"Features"}

Success Criteria : Specific accomplishments that need to be satisfactorily demonstrated to meet the objectives of a technical review so that a technical effort can progress further in the life cycle . $$ 
In these cases , the focus of the SER is on obtaining accurate decisions quickly . $$ 
The design should be feasible and credible when judged by a knowledgeable independent review team and should have sufficient depth to support cost modeling and operational assessment . $$ {"endOffset":85,"startOffset":60,"label":"System Concepts"}
Early in a program , components such as bearings , gears , and flex cables can be subjected to accelerated life tests to identify show stoppers . $$ 
Over the years , many different technologies have been used for launch restraint and release . $$ {"endOffset":44,"startOffset":32,"label":"System Concepts "},{"endOffset":21,"startOffset":17,"label":"Numerical"},{"endOffset":70,"startOffset":64,"label":"Events"}
These variations are employed selectively in order to design kinematic , thermally compatible couplings between components . $$ {"endOffset":70,"startOffset":54,"label":"Features"}
Consequently , the minimum eclipse duration will be approximately half of the maximum duration , or about 17 min . $$ {"endOffset":112,"startOffset":100,"label":"Numerical"}
Early and close involvement of SMA representatives can be key in ensuring that proposed changes are appropriate and within the project s allowable risk tolerance . $$ {"endOffset":34,"startOffset":31,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Finally , the mission concept is how all of these elements work together to satisfy the needs of the key players in the system . $$ 
This numerical specification of an orbit is called the orbit elements . $$ {"endOffset":69,"startOffset":54,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
They have since become commonly used throughout the engineering field and often acquire differences in meaning from discipline to discipline , some differences subtle , some not so subtle . $$ {"endOffset":64,"startOffset":52,"label":"Features"}
Here we determine the power , weight , and pointing budgets and decide what to process on the ground or in space . $$ 
This section describes the V \u0026 V that will be performed on these major assemblies . $$ 
If the space mission engineering process is successful , we will have defined a space mission that is sufficiently low cost , low risk , and near term , with sufficient performance that the customer is willing and anxious to proceed to build the system . $$ 
This section will define any key terms used in the plan . $$ 
How will the tools be integrated ? $$ 
It includes what minimum and maximum extremes will be used on qualification tests thermal , vibration , etc . $$ 
If required , define the conversion between measurement systems . $$ 
This can be accommodated either by having the functions handled in separate computers or using a separate I O processor to queue data from the process with a large number of interrupts . $$ 
They are highly tolerant of shock loads and can be made to run quietly and with almost zero backlash . $$ 
Since the orbit period at this altitude is approximately 105 min see Sec . $$ 
However , human system risks may only be recognized by HSI domain and integration experts . $$ 
For SCS , our basic goal is to let disaster relief workers in a remote location communicate with the people that can provide the help and guidance they need to reduce suffering and save lives and property . $$ 
We would like to determine the frequency and duration of eclipses for the satellite . $$ 
There are two types of modeling techniques available : deterministic and stochastic . $$ 
Pre Phase A is defined as Concept Studies whose purpose is to produce a broad spectrum of ideas and alternatives for missions from which new programs projects can be selected . $$ 
Phase C is defined as Final Design and Fabrication whose purpose is to complete the detailed design of the system and its associated subsystems , including its operations systems , fabricate hardware , and code software . $$ 
Along the top of the spreadsheet matrix are the various parameters and alternatives that one might assess , such as power , orbit , and staffing levels for ground stations . $$ {"endOffset":40,"startOffset":33,"label":"Features"}

Decisions are based on facts , qualitative and quantitative data , engineering judgment , and open communications to facilitate the flow of information throughout the hierarchy of forums where technical analyses and evaluations are presented and assessed and where decisions are made . $$ 
NGOs provide a mechanism to ensure that everyone implementer , customer , and other stakeholders is in agreement at the beginning of a project in terms of defining the problem that needs to be solved and its scope . $$ {"endOffset":5,"startOffset":0,"label":"Organization"}
This is usually accomplished through use case scenarios sometimes referred to as DRMs and the ConOps . $$ 
Propulsion can be via finite burns typically chemical and continuous typically electric $$ 
Although mission designers can t control the subject itself , they can control how to sense the subject . $$

State the basic assumptions and constraints in the development of the concept . $$ 
Phase B is defined as Preliminary Design and Technology Completion whose purpose is to define the project in enough detail to establish an initial baseline capable of meeting mission needs . $$ 
Also , the RF communication signal from and antenna must be passed through the antenna gimbal . $$ 
The criteria should be updated , with concurrence from the decision maker , to more correctly reflect the suitability of each alternative . $$ 
RIDM informs SEG decisions through better use of risk and uncertainty information in selecting alternatives and establishing baseline requirements . $$ 
Describes the overall process by which the results of these V \u0026 V activities will be used to certify that the system meets its requirements and expectations and is ready to be put into the field or fly . $$ 
They are easier to install and far less expensive than rolling element bearings , but they can be less precise unless preloaded . $$ 
In any case , for successful analysis , we must document the real reasons so others can reevaluate them later when the situation may be different . $$ 
It should show how the engineers engineering disciplines relate . $$ 
For additional guidance on functional flow block diagrams , requirements allo cation sheets models , N squared diagrams , timing analysis , and state analysis refer to Appendix F in the $$ 
We will use orbit and trajectory interchangeable , although authors prefer to use orbit to mean only a closed circular or elliptical path and trajectory to refer to other shapes such as hyperbola or paths which intersect the surface of the Earth . $$ 
Note that the issue of integration affects the TRL of every system , subsystem , and component . $$ 
For the FireSat II mission , the subject is probably the heat from the fire itself and the payload is probably an IR sensor . $$ 
System Definition Review : The Mission System Definition Review MDR SDR evaluates whether the proposed mission system architecture is responsive to the program mission system functional and performance requirements and requirements have been allocated to all functional elements of the mis sion system . $$ {"endOffset":71,"startOffset":27,"label":"Organization"}

The form of the end product is a function of the life cycle phase and the placement within the system structure the form of the end product could be hardware , software , model , prototype , first article for test , or single operational article or multiple production articles . $$ 
Providing technical work directives to CAMs produces a more organized technical team . $$ {"endOffset":44,"startOffset":39,"label":"Organization"}
In addition to developing , documenting , and base lining stakeholder expectations , the ConOps and MOEs discussed above and other work products from this process should be captured . $$ {"endOffset":105,"startOffset":100,"label":"Organization"},{"endOffset":95,"startOffset":88,"label":"Operation Concepts"}

It is important to remember that the main value of the SEMP is in the work that goes into the planning . $$ {"endOffset":59,"startOffset":54,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
It is important to always remember that objectives are not requirements . $$ 
If the requirement states a method of implementation , the rationale should state why the decision was made to limit the solution to this one method of implementation . $$ {"endOffset":52,"startOffset":28,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Operational Environment : The environment in which the final product will be operated . $$ {"endOffset":23,"startOffset":0,"label":"System Concepts"}
Although the budget and schedule allocated to the program project serve as constraints , the technical team generates a technical cost estimate and schedule based on the actual work required to satisfy the technical requirements . $$ {"endOffset":228,"startOffset":206,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
It is imperative that there be a continual interaction between the technology development process , crosscutting processes such as HSI , and the design process to ensure that the design reflects the realities of the available technology and that overreliance on immature technology is avoided . $$ {"endOffset":236,"startOffset":216,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
If upfront work is not done to understand the messages and errors arising during this test , additional time in the HWIL facility may result in significant cost and schedule impacts . $$ {"endOffset":120,"startOffset":116,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Technical Risk Reports : Reports of the techni cal risk policies , status , remaining residual risks , actions taken , etc . $$ {"endOffset":22,"startOffset":0,"label":"Operation Concepts"}

The Verification program is performed once regardless of how many flight units may be generated as long as the design doesn t change . $$ 
Then ensure that it meets the same V \u0026 V as a purchased product or a built product . $$ {"endOffset":41,"startOffset":35,"label":"Organization"}
Also in this process , lower level products are assembled into higher level products and checked $$ 
The documentation , specifications , and other inputs also need to be reviewed to ensure they are ready and at an appropriate level of detail to adequately complete the type of implementation form being employed and for the product life cycle phase . $$ {"endOffset":248,"startOffset":237,"label":"System Concepts"}

The basic idea is that before those decisions that are hard to undo are made , the alternatives should be carefully and itera tively assessed , particularly with respect both to the maturity of the required technology and to stakeholder expectations for efficient , effective operations . $$ 
Criteria should also permit differentiating among options or alternatives . $$ {"endOffset":74,"startOffset":61,"label":"Operation Concepts"}

Is the system achievable within budget and schedule constraints ? $$ 
In any case , the decision maker is always free to select any alternative or ask for additional alternatives to be assessed often with updated guidance on selection criteria . $$ 
These technology elements usually exist at a lower level in the PBS . $$ {"endOffset":67,"startOffset":64,"label":"Organization"}
Finally , the multitude of such scenarios is put together , with an understanding of the uncertainties , to create the risk profile of the system . $$ 
Enabling products includes those representing external interfacing products and special test equipment . $$ 
Product Validation Process : A process used to confirm that a verified end product generated by product implementation or product integration fulfills satis fies its intended use when placed in its intended environment and to assure that any anomalies discovered during validation are appropriately resolved prior to delivery of the product if validation is done by the supplier of the product or prior to integration with other products into a higher level assembled product if validation is done by the receiver of the product . $$ {"endOffset":26,"startOffset":0,"label":"System Concepts"}
The SER involvement in this process includes ensuring the product being transitioned has been properly tested and verified validated prior to being shipped to the next level stakeholder customer . $$ {"endOffset":8,"startOffset":4,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
A subset of the verification program is performed at the extremes of the environmental envelope and will ensure the design will operate properly with the expected margins . $$ 
With this defined , a set of alternative solutions can be defined for evaluation . $$ 
During Phase C , activities are performed to establish a complete design product baseline , fabricate or produce hardware , and code software in preparation for integration . $$ 
If operational design and or performance issues are not identified early , the cost of late design changes will be significant . $$ 
Peer Review : Independent evaluation by internal or external SMEs who do not have a vested interest in the work product under review . $$ {"endOffset":66,"startOffset":61,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Concurrent Engineering : Design in parallel rather than serial engineering fashion . $$ 
SERs are involved in this phase to ensure the final detailed designs of the various systems will work together , are compatible , and are likely to meet the customer expectations and applicable requirements . $$ {"endOffset":5,"startOffset":0,"label":"System Concepts"}
As opposed to near Earth space missions , deep space missions may add the need for safety and planetary protection discipline engineering specific to contamination of the Earth or remote solar system bodies . $$ {"endOffset":40,"startOffset":19,"label":"Events"}

These system design processes are primarily applied in Pre Phase A and continue through Phase C . $$ {"endOffset":96,"startOffset":88,"label":"Numerical"},{"endOffset":67,"startOffset":53,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
The sequence will encompass any effort needed $$ 
Dispositioning of recovered flight assets also occurs during this phase . $$ {"endOffset":71,"startOffset":66,"label":"Events"}
It is important to document the fact that these options were considered . $$ 
They characterize the major drivers of operational performance , supportability , and interoperability . $$ 
However , the particular requirements of a spacecraft and mission can cause the skill mix to vary . $$ 
The customer may vary depending on where the SER is working in the PBS . $$ 
Each succeeding transition The documentation required for the Product requires unique input considerations when pre Transition Process depends on the specific end paring the validated product for transition to the product ; its current location within the system next level . $$ {"endOffset":169,"startOffset":159,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":106,"startOffset":87,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
SEG is about tradeoffs and compromises ; it uses a broad crosscutting view of the system rather than a single discipline view . $$ {"endOffset":3,"startOffset":0,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
In order for CM to perform this function , a baseline configuration should be documented and tools used to assess impacts to the baseline . $$ {"endOffset":15,"startOffset":13,"label":"System Concepts"}
TPMs are used to confirm progress and identify deficiencies . $$ {"endOffset":5,"startOffset":0,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
It often uses commercial and or ad hoc components and is not intended to provide definitive information regarding operational performance . $$ 
Additional , unplanned for software engineering resources are typically needed during hardware and systems development and testing to aid in troubleshooting errors anomalies . $$ 
The purpose of SEG is to make sure that the Design Solution Definition Process happens in a way that leads to the most functional , safe , and cost effective final system while working within any given schedule boundaries . $$ {"endOffset":19,"startOffset":15,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":78,"startOffset":44,"label":"Operation Concepts"}

Development of procedures typically begins during the design phase of the project life cycle and matures as the design is matured . $$ 
This integration begins during concept definition and continues throughout the system life cycle . $$ 
It is important in Phase B to validate design decisions against the original goals and objectives and ConOps . $$ {"endOffset":26,"startOffset":19,"label":"System Concepts"}
A threats list is normally used to identify the costs associated with all the risks for the project . $$ 
The planning for Phase D activities was initiated in Phase A . $$ 
A verification approach should be adapted tailored to the project it supports . $$ 
Contractor : An individual , partnership , company , corporation , association , or other service having a contract with the Agency for the design , development , manufacture , maintenance , modification , operation , or supply of items or services under the terms of a contract to a program or project . $$ {"endOffset":147,"startOffset":125,"label":"Organization"},{"endOffset":40,"startOffset":29,"label":"Features"},{"endOffset":51,"startOffset":43,"label":"Features"}
In establishing these status reporting and assessment requirements , some principles of good practice are as follows : $$ 
This is because the way the system is designed will determine how expensive it will be to test , manufacture , integrate , operate , and sustain . $$ 
This may be done informally or formally as appropriate for the complexity of the product . $$ 
4 They should be results oriented focusing on desired outputs and outcomes , not on the methods used to achieve the target what , not how . $$ 
Use evaluation methods as needed to complete the entire decision matrix . $$ {"endOffset":73,"startOffset":55,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
As the system is realized , the issues addressed evolve and the particulars of the activity change . $$ 
Technical assessment is focused on providing a periodic assessment of the program project s technical and programmatic status and health at key points in the life cycle . $$ {"endOffset":169,"startOffset":157,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Once the requirements have been validated and reviewed in the SRR in late Phase A , they are placed under formal configuration control . $$ 
For example , the end product might be one of several circuit cards that will be integrated together to form the final unit that is delivered . $$ 
Generally , objectives should meet four criteria . $$ 
A search concept is developed , and analytical models of the architecture , its elements , and their operations are developed with increased fidelity as the project evolves . $$ 
There are generally two or more MOPs for each MOE . $$ {"endOffset":37,"startOffset":32,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":50,"startOffset":46,"label":"System Concepts"}
These activities include preparing to conduct the transition ; making sure the end product , all personnel , and any enabling products are ready for transitioning ; preparing the site ; and performing the transition including capturing and documenting all work products . $$ {"endOffset":269,"startOffset":256,"label":"Features"}
Hardware In the Loop HWIL should be accounted for in the technical planning contingencies . $$ {"endOffset":26,"startOffset":21,"label":"System Concepts"}
It is important to detect as many errors and failures as possible at the lowest level of integration and early in the life cycle so that changes can be made through the design processes with minimum impact to the project . $$ 
Critical Event or key event : An event in the operations phase of the mission that is time sensitive and is required to be accomplished successfully in order to achieve mission success . $$ 
The frequencies of scenarios with undesired consequences are determined . $$

It is then necessary to assess what is required in the way of development to advance the maturity to a point where it can successfully be incorporated within cost , schedule , and performance constraints . $$ 
Mission : A major activity required to accomplish an Agency goal or to effectively pursue a scientific , technological , or engineering opportunity directly related to an Agency goal . $$ 
It is important to ensure that stakeholders have been identified to support the forum . $$ 
Aggressive , but attainable : Objectives need to be challenging but reachable , and targets need to be realistic . $$ 
The interface management process has a close relationship to V \u0026 V . $$

For example , if a given goal does not support a need , or an objective does not support a goal , it should not be part of the integrated set of NGOs . $$ {"endOffset":149,"startOffset":145,"label":"Organization"}
They can then be baselined with much more confidence . $$ {"endOffset":26,"startOffset":17,"label":"System Concepts"}
Risks associated with design concepts can cause these evaluations to be somewhat nebulous because they are uncertain and are best described by probability distributions . $$ {"endOffset":37,"startOffset":22,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
When achievement of the goals can be quantitatively expressed by such an objective function , designs can be compared in terms of their value . $$ 
In those cases , the appropriate aspects of the applicable forms are used . $$ 
Near the end of the prime mission , the project may apply for a mission extension to continue mission activities or attempt to perform additional mission objectives . $$

Some criteria may not be meaningful to a decision ; however , they should be documented as having been considered . $$ 
Approved drawings the readiness of the system are released and authorized for developers to efficiently produce production . $$ 
Engineering specialty and crosscutting analysis results are integrated into the design , and the manufacturing process and controls are defined and valid . $$ 
This includes such activities as : ITAR , import export control , partner agreements with other domestic or foreign organizations , congressional direction or earmarks , OMB direction , industrial contractor restructuring , external organizational changes , etc . $$ 
Risk status will need to be monitored periodically at a frequency identified in the risk plan . $$ 
An integration strategy is developed and documented in an integration plan . $$ 
Additionally , the state of any technology that is considered enabling should be properly monitored , and care should be taken when assessing the impact of this technology on the concept performance . $$ 
Peer reviews are additional reviews that may be conducted formally or informally to ensure readiness for verification as well as the results of the verification process . $$ 
Teams engaged in the early part of the technical planning process need to identify the required skill mix for technical teams that will develop and produce a product . $$ 
Knowing the impact that a KDR has on the design allows better management of requirements . $$ {"endOffset":30,"startOffset":25,"label":"Operation Concepts"}

A demonstration could also be the actual operation of the end product by highly qualified personnel , such as test pilots , who perform a onetime event that demonstrates a capability to operate at extreme limits of system performance , an operation not normally expected from a representative operational pilot . $$ 
If practicable , a final set of testing with as much of the end to end configuration as possible is important . $$ 
This design solution verification is in contrast to the verification of the end product described in the end product verification plan which is part of the technical data package . $$ 
The actual act of verifying the end product is performed as spelled out in the plans and procedures , and conformance is established with each specified product requirement . $$

These MOPs are given special attention during design to ensure that the MOEs to which they are associated are met . $$ {"endOffset":11,"startOffset":6,"label":"System Concepts"}
It is important in Pre Phase A to develop and mature a clear vision of what problems the proposed program will address , how it will address them , and how the solution will be feasible and cost effective . $$ 
From this effort , the SEMP and other technical plans are developed and baselined . $$ {"endOffset":28,"startOffset":23,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Validation Testing : Validation relates back to the ConOps document . $$ {"endOffset":19,"startOffset":0,"label":"System Concepts"}
The ability to perform these studies is enhanced by the development of system models that relate the design parameters to those assessments , but it does not depend upon them . $$ 
The plan identifies the type of validation , the validation procedures , and the validation environment that are appropriate to confirm that the realized end product conforms to stakeholder expectations . $$ 
Operational use scenarios are thought through in order to explore all possible verification activities to be performed . $$ 
Depending on these factors , the form of the design solution definition could be simply a simulation model or a paper study report . $$ 
NOTE : Nonconformance and discrepancy reports may be directly linked with the Technical RM Process . $$ {"endOffset":98,"startOffset":78,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
They further define what we hope to accomplish by addressing the critical issues identified during the problem assessment . $$ 
The technical management processes are the bridges between project management and the technical team . $$ 
The early exploration of alternative designs should be free and open to a wide range of ideas , concepts , and implementations . $$ 
The documentation level of detail is dependent upon where the product is within the product hierarchy and the life cycle . $$ {"endOffset":120,"startOffset":109,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
The answer is that the design effort proceeds to a depth that is sufficient to meet several needs : the design should penetrate sufficiently to allow analytical validation $$ 
And with respect to project phase , some design and analyses may be performed by a single general discipline in Pre Phase A and Phase A , whereas the need to conduct design and analyses in more detail in Phases B and C may indicate the need for multiple specialized subsystem design and discipline engineering skills . $$ 
The reviewers should check that the requirement statements a have bidirectional traceability to the baselined stakeholder expectations ; b were formed using valid assumptions ; and c are essential to and consistent with designing and realizing the appropriate product solution form that will satisfy the applicable product life cycle phase success criteria . $$ 
Examples of these plans are the program or project plan , SEMP if applicable , review plans which may be part of the program or project plan , ILS plan , and EVM plan if applicable . $$ 
Then firm commitments in the form of contracts , agreements , and or operational plans should be put in place to ensure that the enabling products will be available when needed to support the product life cycle phase activities . $$

Once these subsystems are realized , they should be integrated to the appropriate level as designated by the appropriate interface requirements . $$

Documentation includes applicable draft installation , operation , user , maintenance , or training manuals ; applicable baseline documents configuration baseline , specifications , and stakeholder expectations ; and test results that reflect completion of V \u0026 V of the end product . $$ 
Arriving at an agreed to set of goals and objectives can be a long and arduous task . $$ 
Relevant Environment : Not all systems , subsystems , and or components need to be operated in the operational environment in order to satisfactorily address performance margin requirements or stakeholder expectations . $$

The availability of appropriately skilled personnel also needs to be considered . $$ 
Because of the recursive nature of successive refinement , intermediate levels of decomposition are often validated and baselined as part of the process . $$ 
Alternatively , technological advances may make it uneconomical to continue operating the system either in its current configuration or an improved one . $$ 
This list will need to be updated periodically . $$ 
These processes start with a study team collecting and clarifying the stakeholder expectations , including the mission objectives , constraints , design drivers , operational objectives , and criteria for defining mission success . $$ 
These requirements need to be reviewed during the preparation stage . $$ 
Coordination with the relevant stakeholders for the identified risks is included . $$

The SER should weigh the importance of the unquantifiable factors along with the quantitative data . $$ {"endOffset":8,"startOffset":4,"label":"System Concepts"}
Early in the life cycle , the technical plans are established and synchronized to run the design and realization processes . $$ 
Sometimes a constraint is dictated by external factors such as orbital mechanics , an existing system that must be utilized external interface , a regulatory restriction , or the state of technology ; sometimes constraints are the result of the overall budget environment . $$ 
As such , they can be synonymous with mission project success criteria . $$ 
In comparison with configuration item testing , end to end testing addresses each configuration item end product only down to the level designated by the verification plan generally , the segment r element and focuses on external interfaces , which can be either hardware , software , or human based . $$ 
An essential feature of the SEG process is that trade studies are performed before decisions are made . $$ {"endOffset":31,"startOffset":28,"label":"Operation Concepts"}

After identifying the technology gaps existing in a given design concept , it is frequently necessary to undertake technology development in order to ascertain viability . $$ 
Planning for the update of the SEMP based on programmatic changes needs to be developed and implemented . $$ {"endOffset":36,"startOffset":31,"label":"System Concepts"}
After the interface requirements have been baselined , the Requirements Management Process should be used to identify the need for changes , evaluate the impact of the proposed change , document the final approval disapproval , and update the requirements documentation tool database . $$ 
These agreements are also used to document the customer and provider responsibilities for defining products to be delivered . $$ 
The verification lead should ensure that the procedures were followed and performed as planned , the verification enabling products and instrumentation were calibrated correctly , and the data were collected and recorded for required verification measures . $$ 
Assessment Results , Findings , and Recommendations : This is the collective data on the established measures from which trends can be determined and variances from expected results can be understood . $$

Logical decomposition utilizes functional analysis to create a system architecture and to decompose top level or parent requirements and allocate them down to the lowest desired levels of the project . $$ 
This includes developing technical assessment strategies and policies , assessing technical work productivity , assessing product quality , tracking and trending technical metrics , and conducting technical , peer , and life cycle reviews . $$

This boundary is typically established by performing the following activities : $$ 
The SEMP is driven by the type of project , the phase in the project life cycle , and the technical development risks and is written specifically for each project or project element . $$ 
Changes can be major or minor . $$ 
CERRs are established at the discretion of program . $$ 
Developing a solid ConOps in early phases of the project and refining it through the requirements development and design phases is critical to preventing unsuccessful validation . $$ {"endOffset":26,"startOffset":19,"label":"System Concepts"}
The general philosophy is that the simpler , less complex projects should require much less documentation and fewer formal reviews . $$ 
This section address the types of technical reviews typically conducted for both space flight and research and technology programs projects and the role of these reviews in supporting management decision processes . $$ 
AS9100 is a widely adopted and standardized quality management system developed for the commercial aerospace industry . $$ 
The system architecture can be seen as the strategic organization of the functional elements of the system , laid out to enable the roles , relationships , dependencies , and interfaces between elements to be clearly defined and understood . $$ 
The SEMP is the rule book that describes to all participants how the project will be technically managed . $$ {"endOffset":9,"startOffset":4,"label":"System Concepts"}
Configuration identification is the systematic process of selecting , organizing , and stating the product attributes . $$ 
Devise some alternative means to meet the functional requirements . $$ 
Variations , anomalies , and out of compliance conditions , where such have been detected , are documented along with the actions taken to resolve the discrepancies . $$ 
The creation of alternative design solutions involves assessment of potential capabilities offered by the continually changing state of technology . $$ 
This will define , for example , whether NASA expects the vendor to provide a fully verified and validated product or whether the NASA technical team will be performing those duties . $$ 
Documentation may include operations manuals , installation instructions , and other information . $$ 
It also site or operational facility and to ensures that the system has install software and hardware for sufficient technical maturity to operational use . $$ 
For space flight systems projects , the NASA life cycle phases of Formulation and Implementation divide into the following seven incremental pieces . $$ 
This is normally accomplished through the use of the CM Process . $$ {"endOffset":65,"startOffset":53,"label":"Artifact"}
The SE NPR does not require a waiver deviation for this customization ; however , departures from review elements required by other NPRs need to be addressed by tailoring those documents . $$ 
It describes the system from an operational perspective and helps facilitate an understanding of the system $$ 
This requires coordination with the ILS engineer . $$ 
For those issues for which the process of successive refinement has proceeded far enough , the next step is to implement the decisions at that level of resolution . $$ 
Major products to this point include an accepted functional baseline for the system and its major end items . $$ 
During project Formulation , the ConOps of the product is analyzed to identify both external and internal interfaces . $$ 
Analysis includes the use of modeling and simulation as analytical tools . $$ 
This process also establishes a plan for identifying and defining the technical effort required to satisfy the project objectives and life cycle phase success criteria within the cost , schedule , and risk constraints of the project . $$ 
NASA has four baselines , each of which defines a distinct phase in the evolution of a product design . $$ {"endOffset":5,"startOffset":0,"label":"Organization"}

For example , the propellant performance margin will provide the necessary propellant available versus the propellant necessary to complete the mission . $$ {"endOffset":95,"startOffset":75,"label":"System Concepts"}
Acquisition , which may include procurement contracting for products and services , begins with an idea or proposal that aligns with the NASA Strategic Plan and fulfills an identified need and ends with the completion of the program or project or the final disposition of the product or service . $$ 
They identify what support will be needed and any enabling products that will need to be developed in order to generate the end product . $$ 
Rarely if ever is it possible to produce a combined quantitative measure that relates all of the important factors , even if it is expressed as a vector with several components . $$ 
The design solution definition will be used to generate the end product specifications that will be used to produce the product and to conduct product verification . $$ 
For either of the forms of product transition , the receiving site needs to be prepared to receive the product . $$ 
Metric : The result of a measurement taken over a period of time that communicates vital information about the status or performance of a system , process , or activity . $$ 
These products may be realized through their purchase from commercial or other vendors , through partial or complete reuse of products from other projects or activities , or they may be generated from scratch . $$ 
The SEMP also communicates how the SEG management techniques will be applied throughout all phases of the project life cycle . $$ {"endOffset":124,"startOffset":114,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":9,"startOffset":4,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":60,"startOffset":35,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
The form of this product is dependent on the phase of the product life cycle and the phase exit success criteria . $$ 
While the project manager concentrates on managing the overall project life cycle , the technical team , led by the SER , concentrates on managing the technical aspects of the project . $$ {"endOffset":120,"startOffset":116,"label":"System Concepts"}
For large programs , this will typically be the Engineering TA . $$ 
This might be accomplished by running a Monte Carlo simulation analysis and also running actual tests on a few of the key cases . $$ 
The technical team needs to transform this statement into a set of design to functional and performance requirements . $$ 
Planning data , status reporting data , and assessments flow up the hierarchy with appropriate aggregation at each level ; decisions cause actions to be taken down the hierarchy . $$ 
Budgeting and resource planning involve establishing a reasonable project baseline budget and the capability to analyze changes to that baseline resulting from technical and or schedule changes . $$ 
System validation confirms that the integrated realized end products conform to stakeholder expectations as captured in the MOEs , MOPs , and ConOps . $$

Project reserves are used to mitigate the appropriate risk . $$ 
They are viewed as part of the system since the end product and its enabling products are interdependent . $$ 
NOTE : For systems where only a single deliverable item is developed , the Product Validation Process normally completes acceptance testing of the system . $$ 
Some options may quickly drop out of consideration as the analysis is conducted . $$ 
This analysis will establish the origin , destination , stimuli , and special characteristics of the interfaces that need to be documented and maintained . $$ 
The decisions that are made are generally entered into the CM system as changes to or elaborations of the system baseline . $$ {"endOffset":68,"startOffset":59,"label":"System Concepts"}
Additionally , according to SAE EIA 649B , improper CM may result in incorrect , ineffective , and or unsafe products being released . $$ {"endOffset":39,"startOffset":28,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":54,"startOffset":52,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
The official controlled versions of these documents are generally maintained in electronic format within the requirements management tool $$ 
KDPs define transitions between the phases . $$ {"endOffset":4,"startOffset":0,"label":"System Concepts"}
These are measures that represent expectations that are critical to the success of the system , and failure to satisfy these measures will cause the stakeholder to deem the system unacceptable . $$ 
SEG is involved in all aspects of this phase including answering questions , providing advice , resolving issues , assessing results of the V \u0026 V tests , ensuring that the V \u0026 V results meet the customer expectations and applicable requirements , and providing information to decision makers for go no go decisions . $$ {"endOffset":4,"startOffset":0,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":146,"startOffset":140,"label":"System Concepts"}
If the project waits until verification to do any type of test or analysis , any problems found will have a significant cost impact to redesign and reverify . $$ 
Center and Agency directives sometimes specify content of documents and are appropriately used for in house data preparation . $$ 
The technical team may have to choose among designs that differ in terms of numerous attributes . $$ 
Scheduling is an essential component of planning and managing the activities of a project . $$ 
It includes identification of activities and deliverables end products and work products and outputs of the development and operations . $$ 
Early in the life cycle , this documentation may be preliminary in nature . $$ 
One of the key inputs to preparing for CM implementation is a strategic plan for the project s complete CM process . $$ {"endOffset":56,"startOffset":39,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":114,"startOffset":104,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
There is a tendency on the part of technology developers and project management to overestimate the maturity and applicability of a technology that is required to implement a design . $$ 
The product should satisfy the design solution and its specified requirements . $$ 
The verification environment is considered as part of procedure development . $$

In other words , SEG is a logical way of thinking . $$ {"endOffset":21,"startOffset":17,"label":"System Concepts"}
These processes should be used as guidance and tailored for each study team depending on the size of the project and the hierarchical level of the study team . $$ 
Every member of the technical team relies on technical planning ; management of requirements , interfaces , technical risk , configuration , and technical data ; technical assessment ; and decision analysis to meet the project s objectives . $$ 
These may include site plans , special handling procedures , training , certifications , videos , inspections , or other products from these activities . $$ {"endOffset":87,"startOffset":72,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":59,"startOffset":48,"label":"Features"},{"endOffset":70,"startOffset":61,"label":"Features"}
Even when that can be done , it is essential that the underlying actors and relationships be thoroughly revealed to and understood by the SER . $$ 
Therefore , in order to protect and ensure the integrity of NASA products , NASA has endorsed the implementation of the five CM functions and the associated 37 underlying principles defined within SAE EIA 649 2 CM Requirements for NASA Enterprises . $$ {"endOffset":64,"startOffset":60,"label":"Organization"},{"endOffset":81,"startOffset":76,"label":"Organization"},{"endOffset":213,"startOffset":197,"label":"Organization"},{"endOffset":236,"startOffset":231,"label":"Organization"}

NOTE : Completing the decision matrix can be thought of as a default evaluation method . $$ 
Involving stakeholders in a project builds confidence in the end product and serves as a validation and acceptance with the target audience . $$ 
Breadboard : A low fidelity unit that demonstrates function only without considering form or fit in the case of hardware or platform in the case of software . $$ 
Prepare the integration environment in which assembly and integration will take place , including evaluating the readiness of the product integration enabling products and the assigned workforce . $$ {"endOffset":194,"startOffset":185,"label":"System Concepts"}
Demonstrations can involve the use of physical models or mock ups ; for example , an expectation that controls are readable by the pilot in low light conditions could be validated by having a pilot perform flight related tasks in a cockpit mock up or simulator under those conditions . $$ 
Validation also ensures that any anomalies discovered are appropriately resolved prior to product delivery . $$ 
This allows a quick turnaround in case the data indicates that a correction to the test or analysis run needs to be performed again . $$ 
The form of the processed data is dependent on the documentation , report , review formats , or templates that are applicable . $$ 
Typically , a SRR is held to allow comments on any needed changes and to gain agreement on the set of requirements so that it may be subsequently baselined . $$ {"endOffset":18,"startOffset":14,"label":"System Concepts"}
Configuration change management is achieved through the systematic proposal , justification , and evaluation of proposed changes followed by incorporation of approved changes and verification of implementation . $$ {"endOffset":75,"startOffset":56,"label":"System Concepts"}

A metric should drive appropriate action . $$ 
This should address the adequacy of existing facilities to accept , store , and operate the new end product and identify any logistical support enabling products and services required but not planned for . $$ 
The process for managing requirements changes needs to take into account the distribution of information related to the decisions made during the change process . $$ 
Some Centers use deviations prior to Implementation and waivers during Implementation . $$ 
Thoroughly understand and plan the scope of the technical effort by investing time upfront to develop the technical PBS , the technical schedule and workflow diagrams , and the technical resource requirements and constraints funding , budget , facilities , and long lead items that will be the technical planning infrastructure . $$

In cases where hazardous materials are involved , special labeling or handling needs , including transportation routes , need to be in place . $$ 
If discrepancies are found , it needs TBD if they are a result of the test configuration or analysis assumptions or whether they are a TRUE characteristic or behavior of the end product . $$ 
Design purchase specifications will have been generated during requirements development and provided as inputs . $$ 
Qualification Unit : A unit that is the same as the flight unit form , fit , function , components , etc . $$ 
During the Formulation Phase , the roles of the stakeholders should be defined in the project plan and the SEMP . $$ 
The contractor s there are no during contract will typically develop a SEMP or its contracts performance , and equivalent to describe the technical involved upon contract activities in their portion of the completion in the project , but an overarching SEMP $$ 
It puts a stake in the ground and gets everyone on the design team focused on the same concept . $$ 
Trade studies continue and results are used to validate the design against project goals , objectives , and ConOps . $$ 
The technical team should organize the technical tasks according to the project WBS in a logical sequence of events , taking into consideration the major project milestones , phasing of available funding , and timing of the availability of supporting resources . $$ 
The supporting trade studies are archived for future use . $$ 
Once the validation activities have been completed , the results are collected and the data are analyzed to confirm that the end product provided will supply the customer s needed capabilities within the intended environments of use , validation procedures were followed , and enabling products and supporting resources functioned correctly . $$ 
Once consistency is achieved , analyses allow the project team to validate the proposed design against the stakeholder expectations . $$

This design solution validation is in contrast to the validation of the end product described in the end product validation plan , which is part of the technical data package . $$ 
If the required modifications and or operating environments fall outside the realm of experience , then these too should be considered technology development . $$ 
This includes establishing CM strategies and policies , identifying baselines to be under configuration control , maintaining the status of configuration documentation , and conducting configuration audits $$ {"endOffset":29,"startOffset":27,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
It will show that the correct design option has been selected , interfaces have been identified , and verification methods have been described . $$ 
The purpose of end to end testing is to demonstrate interface compatibility and desired total functionality among different elements of a mission system , between systems the system of interest and external enabling systems , and within a system as a whole . $$ 
A successful review the required number of systems . $$ 
Enabling products are the life cycle support products , infrastructures , personnel , logistics , and services that facilitate the progression and use of the operational end product through its life cycle . $$ 
Many projects will have characteristics of multiple types , so the tailoring approach may permit more tailoring for those aspects of the project that are simpler and more open to risk and less tailoring for those aspects of the project where complexity and or risk aversion dominate . $$ 
As the analysis proceeds to lower levels of the architecture and system , and the system is better understood , the SER should keep an open mind and a willingness to go back and change previously established architecture and system requirements . $$ {"endOffset":120,"startOffset":116,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Such involvement should be built in as a self correcting feedback loop that will significantly enhance the chances of mission success . $$ 
Goals need not be in a quantitative or measurable form , but they should allow us to assess whether the system has achieved them . $$ 
Some activities may have their integration plans captured under the integration plan of the sponsoring flight program or R \u0026 T program . $$

The initial technical planning at the beginning of the project establishes the technical team members ; their roles and responsibilities ; and the tools , processes , and resources that will be utilized in executing the technical effort . $$ 
The technical processes are applied recursively and iteratively to break down the initializing concepts of the system to a level of detail concrete enough that the technical team can implement a product from the information . $$ 
In doing so , the SER should keep in mind that the potentials for change may include organizational structure , personnel constraints , schedules , procedures , and any of the other things that make up a system . $$ {"endOffset":22,"startOffset":18,"label":"System Concepts"}
These activities have time precedence relationships among them that may be used to create a network schedule explicitly defining the dependencies of each activity on other activities , the availability of resources , and the receipt of receivables from outside sources . $$

This disposal can involve the safe reentry and recovery or impact in the ocean , impact on the moon , or solar trajectory . $$ 
In the next level of decomposition , the baselined requirements become the set of high level requirements for the decomposed elements , and the process begins again . $$ 
These new requirements are the result of evolution , and if we are to build a relevant system , we can not ignore them . $$ 
Major outputs of CM are : $$ {"endOffset":19,"startOffset":17,"label":"System Concepts"}
FRR : A review that examines tests , demonstrations , analyses , and audits that determine the system s readiness for a safe and successful flight launch and for subsequent flight operations . $$ {"endOffset":3,"startOffset":0,"label":"System Concepts"}
Often outside groups are not aware of the system goals and capabilities until it is almost too late in the process . $$ 
Whether system models are used or not , the design concepts are developed , modified , reassessed , and compared against competing alternatives in a closed loop process that seeks the best choices for further development . $$ 
The activities and events leading up to the discrepancy should be analyzed to determine if a nonconforming product exists or there is an issue with the verification procedure , conduct , or conditions . $$ 
It does not require an SRB . $$ 
The interactions between these three integrated natures of the system need to be managed throughout development and into operations for mission success . $$ 
Phase D concludes with a system that has been shown to be capable of accomplishing the purpose for which it was created . $$ 
Preparing to conduct the product implementation is a key first step regardless of what form of implementation has been selected . $$ 
CDR Critical Design Review ORR Operational Readiness Review $$ {"endOffset":59,"startOffset":27,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
It shows that the correct design options have been selected , interfaces have been identified , and verification methods have been described . $$ 
For technical planning to be conducted properly , the processes and procedures that are needed to conduct technical planning should be identified , defined , and communicated . $$ 
Technical reviews of the data and analyses , including TMAs , are an important part of the decision support packages prepared for the technical team . $$ {"endOffset":59,"startOffset":55,"label":"System Concepts"}
Confirm that the received products that are to be assembled and integrated have been validated to demonstrate that the individual products satisfy the agreed to set of stakeholder expectations , including interface requirements . $$ 
Mission needs are independent of any particular system or technological solution . $$ {"endOffset":80,"startOffset":58,"label":"System Concepts"}

This output is the list of all the items , documents , hardware , software , models , etc . , that were identified as needing to be placed under configuration control . $$ 
The following is guidance in implementation of RM in general . $$ {"endOffset":49,"startOffset":47,"label":"System Concepts"}
This interaction is facilitated through a periodic assessment of the design with respect to the maturity of the technology required to implement the design . $$ 
Perform system end product Test , Launch implementation , assembly , I \u0026 T , and transition to use . $$ 
It ensures that the production plans , fabrication , assembly , integration enabling products , operational support , and personnel are in place and ready to begin production . $$ 
It is important for the SER to know what type of program a project falls under so that the appropriate scope of the technical work , documentation requirements , and set of reviews can be determined . $$ {"endOffset":28,"startOffset":24,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Communication and iteration with the relevant stakeholders are essential to ensure a mutual understanding of each requirement . $$ 
A COTS product would typically contain a manufacturer s specification or fact sheet . $$ {"endOffset":7,"startOffset":2,"label":"System Concepts"}
Qualification is performed once regardless of how many flight units may be generated as long as the design doesn t change . $$ {"endOffset":67,"startOffset":55,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":106,"startOffset":100,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
The program project life cycle should provide managers with incremental visibility into the progress being made at points in time that fit with the management and budgetary environments . $$ 
Baselining too early takes the inventive nature out of the concept exploration . $$ 
Margins are allocated in the formulation process based on assessments of risks and are typically consumed as the program project proceeds through the life cycle . $$ 
For most NASA projects and tightly coupled programs , the baselining of a single architecture happens during Phase A . $$ {"endOffset":13,"startOffset":9,"label":"Organization"}

Whether transitioning a product to the next room for integration into the next higher assembly , or for final transportation across the country to the customer , care should be taken to ensure the safe transportation of the product . $$ {"endOffset":160,"startOffset":151,"label":"Person/People"},{"endOffset":31,"startOffset":8,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":94,"startOffset":53,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":124,"startOffset":104,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Additionally , any modifications to existing facilities should be planned well in advance of fielding ; therefore , the site survey should be made during an early phase in the product life cycle . $$ 
As the system development nears completion , the Product Transition Process is again applied for the end product , but with much more rigor since now the transition objective is delivery of the system level end product to the actual end user . $$ 
In the product realization side of the SE engine , five interdependent processes result in systems that meet the design specifications and stakeholder expectations . $$ {"endOffset":41,"startOffset":39,"label":"System Concepts"}
Typically , attempting final validation against the ConOps on a prototype is not acceptable : it is usually completed on a qualification , flight , or other more final , controlled unit . $$ {"endOffset":59,"startOffset":52,"label":"System Concepts"}
Electronic technical data should be stored with sufficient metadata to enable easy retrieval and sorting . $$ 
This will vary from project to project . $$ 
Prior to CDR , NASA normally reviews design output for conformance to design requirements through incremental deliveries of engineering data . $$ {"endOffset":13,"startOffset":9,"label":"Organization"},{"endOffset":20,"startOffset":15,"label":"Organization"}
Developed early in Pre Phase A by the technical team , describes the overall high level concept of how the system will be used to meet stakeholder expectations , usually in a time sequenced manner . $$ {"endOffset":30,"startOffset":19,"label":"System Concepts"}

Procedures necessary for conducting the transition should be reviewed and approved by this time . $$ 
SAR generally applies to human space flight . $$ {"endOffset":3,"startOffset":0,"label":"System Concepts"}
In addition to uncertainty about when this part of the phase begins , the activities associated with safe closeout of a system may be long and complex and may affect the system design . $$ 
In some cases , the engineering unit will become the final product , assuming that proper traceability has been exercised over the components and hardware handling . $$ 
NOTE : Requirements can be generated from non obvious stakeholders and may not directly support the current mission and its objectives , but instead provide an opportunity to gain additional benefits or information that can support the Agency or the Nation . $$ 
To conduct the mission and meet the initially identified need and maintain support for that need . $$ 
An integration plan should be developed and documented to capture this planning . $$ 
Cost Benefit Analysis : A methodology to determine the advantage of one alternative over another in terms of equivalent cost or benefits . $$ {"endOffset":21,"startOffset":0,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Advanced studies may extend for several years and are typically focused on establishing mission goals and formulating top level system requirements and ConOps . $$ 
Similarly , developing clear expectations for user community involvement in the HSI Plan is critical to successful validation . $$ 
Any supporting manuals , drawings , or other documentation available should also be gathered . $$ 
NOTE : Verification planning begins early in the project life cycle during the requirements development phase . $$ 
A second reason could be a shortfall in the verification process of the end product . $$ 
Larger programs and projects need to have a separate integration plan to clearly lay out the complex analysis and tests that need to occur . $$ 
Alternatively , if there is no stand alone SEMP and the contents of the SEMP are incorporated into another document such as the project plan , the Compliance Matrix can be captured within that plan . $$ {"endOffset":48,"startOffset":43,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":77,"startOffset":72,"label":"System Concepts"}
The SER is not only cognizant of these operations team interactions , but is also involved in the design responses and updates to changes in mission parameters and unintended consequences through fault management . $$ {"endOffset":7,"startOffset":4,"label":"Organization"}
As the project moves through the life cycle , these paper or soft products are transformed through implementation and integration processes into hardware and software solutions to meet the stakeholder expectations . $$ 
This may involve more or less rigor and formality than that specified in governing documents such as NPRs . $$ {"endOffset":106,"startOffset":101,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
A NASA field Center can often shape a contractor s verification process through the project s SOW . $$ {"endOffset":7,"startOffset":2,"label":"Organization"},{"endOffset":98,"startOffset":94,"label":"Features"}
Design factors of safety , margins , and other required D \u0026 C standards should also be assessed . $$ {"endOffset":71,"startOffset":56,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Phase B results in a preliminary design that satisfies the approval criteria . $$ {"endOffset":8,"startOffset":0,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
This external commitment is the ABC . $$ {"endOffset":35,"startOffset":32,"label":"Organization"}
The design requirements should have already addressed the ease of handling or transporting the product such as component staking , addition of transportation hooks , crating , etc . $$ 
Launch and prepare for operations . $$ 
The basic tasks that need to be established involve the management of internal and external interactions of the various levels of products and operator tasks to support product integration and are as follows : $$ 
Reviews by the Center CMO are warranted and will cost resources and time , but the correction of systemic CM problems before they erupt into losing configuration control are always preferable to explaining why incorrect or misidentified parts are causing major problems in the program project . $$ {"endOffset":25,"startOffset":22,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":108,"startOffset":106,"label":"System Concepts"}
To produce a broad spectrum of ideas and alternatives for missions from which new programs and projects can be selected . $$ 
Inspection is generally used to validate the presence of a physical design features or specific manufacturer identification . $$ 
Early in the life cycle , this documentation may be conceptual or preliminary in nature . $$ {"endOffset":23,"startOffset":0,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
A vast number of key complex activities , many of them outside direct control of the technical team , need to be synchronized to ensure smooth transition to the end user . $$ 
To accomplish this integration , the SER is active in integrating the different discipline and design teams to ensure system and environmental interactions are being properly balanced by the differing design teams . $$ {"endOffset":41,"startOffset":37,"label":"System Concepts"}
This determines the project s length and cost . $$ 
It is a set of activities that can be employed during selected hardware , software , and system phases throughout the life cycle using developmental forms and external simulators . $$ 
As used in the context of the SEG common technical processes , a product is one provided by either the Product Implementation Process or the Product Integration Process in a form suitable for meeting applicable life cycle phase success criteria . $$ {"endOffset":33,"startOffset":30,"label":"Organization"}
Conceptual designs and analyses including engineering units and physical models , as appropriate are developed and exhibit more engineering detail than in Pre Phase A . $$ 
Procurement of data from an outside supplier is a formal procurement action that requires a procurement document ; in house requirements may be handled using a less formal method . $$ 
Pertinent information may be controlled using a configuration control process or work order system as well as design drawings and test reports . $$ 
1 They should be specific enough to provide clear direction , so developers , customers , and testers will understand them . $$ 
Operational scenarios are used extensively to ensure that the mission system or collections of systems will successfully execute mission requirements . $$ 
CM planning starts at a program s or project s inception . $$ 
After the initial stakeholder expectations have been established , the development of a ConOps will further ensure that the technical team fully understands the expectations and how they may be satisfied by the product , and that understanding has been agreed to by the stakeholders . $$ 
The technical requirements should be sufficiently detailed to establish firm schedule and cost estimates for the project . $$ 
If any of these products or services are lacking , they will need to be developed or arranged for before progressing to the next phase . $$ 
Control Gate or milestone : A defined point in the program project life cycle where the decision authority can evaluate progress and determine next actions . $$ 
The trade study process should be done openly and inclusively . $$ 
This could create the need for : $$ 
Interface control documentation and approved interface requirement changes are used as inputs to the Product Verification Process and the Product Validation Process , particularly where verification test constraints and interface parameters are needed to set the test objectives and test plans . $$ {"endOffset":121,"startOffset":101,"label":"Features"},{"endOffset":156,"startOffset":138,"label":"Features"}
These alternative solutions are then analyzed through detailed trade studies that result in the selection of a preferred alternative . $$ 
The activities of the Product Integration Process are truncated to indicate the action and object of the action . $$ 
The project team should also identify the constraints that may apply . $$ 
End to end tests may be performed as part of investigative engineering tests , verification testing , or validation testing . $$ 
Descope : As a verb , take out of or remove from the scope of a project . $$ 
Verification tests use instrumentation and measurements and are generally accomplished by engineers , technicians , or operator maintainer test personnel in a controlled environment to facilitate failure analysis . $$ {"endOffset":212,"startOffset":204,"label":"System Concepts"}

Once the tailoring is finalized and recorded in the Compliance Matrix with appropriate rationales , the requested tailoring proceeds through the appropriate governance model for approval . $$ 
These models should include hazard analyses and controls implemented through fault management . $$

Support strategies include provisions for fabrication , test , deployment , operations , sustainment , and disposal . $$ {"endOffset":54,"startOffset":42,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":61,"startOffset":56,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":74,"startOffset":63,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":87,"startOffset":76,"label":"System Concepts"}
The Phase B baseline consists of a collection of evolving baselines covering technical and business aspects of the project : system and subsystem requirements and specifications , designs , verification and operations plans , and so on in the technical portion of the baseline , and schedules , cost projections , and management plans in the business portion . $$ 
The system needs to create and maintain a balance between the subsystems , optimizing the system performance over any one subsystem to achieve an elegant and efficient design . $$ 
The tasks within each process are discussed in terms of inputs , activities , and outputs . $$ 
Part of the SER s job is to ensure that the design concepts to be compared take into account all interface requirements . $$ {"endOffset":16,"startOffset":12,"label":"System Concepts"}
Therefore , the human element is some thing that integration and SEG processes must address . $$ 
Integration continues during the operations phase , bringing together the system hardware , software , and human operators to perform the mission . $$ 
Need : A single statement that drives everything else . $$ 
Control of the configuration is critical to understanding how changes will impact the system . $$ {"endOffset":93,"startOffset":86,"label":"Artifact"}
Frequent and iterative communications with stakeholders helps to identify operational scenarios and key needs that should be understood when designing and implementing the end product . $$ 
They are detailed , exact statements of design particulars , such as statements prescribing materials , dimensions , and quality of work to build , install , or manufacture the end product . $$ 
It is typically developed by the operational team . $$ 
These activities focus on preparing for the CDR , PRR if required , and the SIR . $$ {"endOffset":48,"startOffset":44,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":53,"startOffset":50,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":80,"startOffset":76,"label":"System Concepts"}
Therefore , baselining should be one of the last steps in the Design Solution Definition Process . $$ 
If alternative orbits are to be considered , a separate concept is needed for each orbit . $$ 
All open issues should cost and schedule constraints . $$ 
A robust decision is one that is based on sufficient technical evidence and characterization of uncertainties to determine that the selected alternative best reflects $$ 
The SEMP is a subordinate document to the project plan . $$ 
Develop final mission concept , analysis , engineering models Development system level requirements , needed system technology and mock ups , and trade Preliminary baseline capable of meeting mission needs . $$ 
These conditions should have been identified early in the design life cycle . $$ 
When possible , actual end users operators should be used and other stakeholders should participate or observe activities as appropriate and practical . $$ 
Products described in the WBS are the result of activities that take time to complete . $$ 
Examples of self derived requirements are requirements that are locally adopted as good practices or are the result of design decisions made while performing the activities of the Logical Decomposition and Design Solution Processes . $$ 
The team needs to work with the acquisition team to ensure the accuracy of the contract SOW or purchase order and to ensure that adequate documentation , certificates of compliance , or other specific needs are requested from the vendor . $$ 
solidified , and the project develops more definition in the system requirements , top level system architecture , and ConOps . $$ 
Objectives expand on the goals and provide a means to document specific expectations . $$ 
The product will likely have been through at least a functional test to ensure it was assembled correctly . $$ 
The larger or more complex the system or the more delicate the element , the more critical the proper sequence becomes , as small changes can cause large impacts on project results . $$ 
This information is reviewed , summarized , and documented so that all parties can come to an agreement on the expectations . $$ 
ConOps Concept Documentation : Developed early in Pre Phase A , the describes the overall high level concept of how the system will be used to meet stakeholder expectations , usually in a time sequenced manner . $$ {"endOffset":29,"startOffset":0,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
The package defines the required design configuration and procedures to ensure adequacy of item performance . $$ 
This evolving critical path with its identified tasks needs to be carefully monitored during the progression of the project . $$ 
Status reporting will identify where the project stands with regard to a particular technical measure . $$ 
Design Solution Definition Process : The process used to translate the outputs of the logical decomposition process into a design solution definition . $$ 
Each of the lower level products that is needed for assembly and integration is obtained from the transitioning lower level product owners or a storage facility as appropriate . $$ 
Often the changes are quite innocent and what appear to be changes to a system are really enhancements in disguise . $$ {"endOffset":103,"startOffset":83,"label":"System Concepts"}
During this phase , technical parameters , schedules , and budgets are closely tracked to ensure that undesirable trends such as an unexpected growth in spacecraft mass or increase in its cost are recognized early enough to take corrective action . $$ 
The purpose of Phase B is for the project team to complete the technology development , engineering prototyping , heritage hardware and software assessments , and other risk mitigation activities identified in the project FA and the preliminary design . $$ 
A method to achieve this verification is by means of a peer review to evaluate the resulting design solution definition . $$ 
Each objective should relate to a particular goal . $$ 
Descope options can also reflect what the mission can accomplish in case a hardware failure results in the loss of a portion of the spacecraft architecture ; for example , what an orbiter can accomplish after the loss of a lander . $$ 
These would have been factors involved in the Decision Analysis Process to determine the make buy reuse decision . $$ 
This also applies to repeating the application of the same processes to the system structure in the next life cycle phase to mature the system definition and satisfy phase exit success criteria . $$ 
These three products should be consistent with each other and will require iterations and design decisions to achieve this consistency . $$ 
Functional analysis is the primary method used in system architecture development and functional requirement decomposition . $$ {"endOffset":19,"startOffset":0,"label":"System Concepts"}
Status on relevant stakeholder involvement should be tracked and corrective action taken if stakeholders are not participating as planned . $$ 
Product Realization : The desired output from the application of the four product realization processes . $$ 
Each project should have already established the mechanism to track and disseminate the latest project information . $$ 
Other tasks in preparing to transition a product involve making sure the end product , personnel , and any enabling products are ready for that transition . $$ 
Reason for the Requirement : Often the reason for the requirement is not obvious , and it may be lost if not recorded as the requirement is being documented . $$ 
Discrepancies between the allocated budget and schedule and the technical team s actual cost estimate and schedule should be reconciled continuously throughout the life cycle . $$ 
Two risk areas bearing on schedule risk are 1 the risk that the schedule estimates and objectives are not realistic and reasonable ; and the risk that program execution will fall short of the schedule objectives as a result of failure to handle cost , schedule , or performance risks . $$

For each initiating event , other events that are relevant to the evolution of the scenario may or may not occur and may have either a mitigating or exacerbating effect on the scenario progression . $$ 
Processes 10 through 17 are crosscutting tools for carrying out the processes . $$ {"endOffset":13,"startOffset":10,"label":"Numerical"},{"endOffset":24,"startOffset":21,"label":"Numerical"}
This is a key source of data on system interactions , and the developmental test program should be structured to include subsystem interactions , HITL evaluations , and environmental interaction test data as appropriate . $$ {"endOffset":151,"startOffset":146,"label":"System Concepts"}
The form depends on the phase a product of early phases might be a simulation or model ; a product of later phases may be the final end product itself . $$ 
Validation testing is focused on the expected environments and operations of the system where as qualification testing includes the worst case loads and environmental requirements within which the system is expected to perform or survive . $$ 
Changes should be assessed for their impact on performance margins . $$ 
The selection of the verification or validation method is based on engineering judgment as to which is the most effective way to reliably show the product s conformance to requirements or that it will operate as intended and described in the ConOps . $$ 
Typically , the SERs are heavily involved in the development and assessment of the concept options . $$ {"endOffset":21,"startOffset":16,"label":"System Concepts"}
Project management such as the project manager the PI the task lead , etc . $$ 
The point is , rather , that the need for decision analysis increases as a function of the above conditions . $$ 
Lower level products to be integrated : These are the products developed in the previous lower level tier in the product hierarchy . $$ {"endOffset":20,"startOffset":0,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":72,"startOffset":54,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Documentation includes applicable final installation , operation , user , maintenance , or training manuals ; applicable baseline documents configuration baseline , specifications , stakeholder expectations ; and test results that reflect completion of V \u0026 V of the end product . $$ {"endOffset":258,"startOffset":253,"label":"System Concepts"}
Even though every technical team member might not be directly involved with these eight processes , they are indirectly affected by these key functions . $$ 
They are typically captured in the form of needs , goals , and objectives with constraints and assumptions identified . $$ {"endOffset":49,"startOffset":43,"label":"Features"},{"endOffset":57,"startOffset":51,"label":"Features"},{"endOffset":74,"startOffset":63,"label":"Features"}
This effort starts with the technical team taking the output from the system design processes and using the appropriate crosscutting functions , such as data and CM , and technical assessments to make , buy , or reuse subsystems . $$ 
Decommissioning Review : A review that confirms the decision to terminate or decommission a system and assess the readiness for the safe decommissioning and disposal of system assets . $$ 
This loop is applicable at each level of the project hierarchy . $$ 
The resulting technical planning strategy constitutes an outline , or rough draft , of the SEMP . $$ {"endOffset":95,"startOffset":91,"label":"System Concepts"}
If the alternatives are precisely defined and thoroughly understood to be well differentiated in the cost effectiveness space , then the SER can make choices among them with confidence . $$ {"endOffset":141,"startOffset":137,"label":"System Concepts"}
End to end testing verifies that the data flows throughout the multisystem environment are correct , that the system provides the required functionality , and that the outputs at the eventual end points correspond to expected results . $$ 
For large flight projects , there may be an extended period of cruise , orbit insertion , on orbit assembly , and initial shakedown operations . $$ 
It is useful to capture information about each of the requirements , called metadata , for future reference and use . $$ 
and capabilities of the project evident from the flight operations experience since launch . $$ 
Finally , the availability and skills of personnel needed to conduct the implementation as well as the availability of any necessary raw materials , enabling products , or special services should also be reviewed . $$ 
Approval for Implementation : The acknowledgment by the decision authority that the program project has met stakeholder expectations and formulation requirements , and is ready to proceed to implementation . $$ {"endOffset":49,"startOffset":34,"label":"System Concepts"}
The KDRs should be identified . $$ {"endOffset":8,"startOffset":4,"label":"System Concepts"}
For example , the peer review of a component battery design can go into much more technical detail on the battery than the integrated power subsystem review . $$ 
Problem IssueDescribe the problem issue that requires a decision . $$ {"endOffset":21,"startOffset":8,"label":"System Concepts"}
At a minimum , these updates will occur at every KDP . $$ {"endOffset":53,"startOffset":49,"label":"System Concepts"}
TPMs : These are the set of performance measures that are monitored and trended by comparing the current actual achievement of the parameters with that expected or required at the time . $$ 
If feasible concepts can be found , one or more may be selected to go into Phase A for further development . $$ 
Performing functional and sensitivity analyses will ensure that the requirements are realistic and evenly allocated . $$ 
They need to be specific enough to provide clear direction , so developers , customers , and testers can understand them . $$ 
For example , to verify the performance of a product may require looking at many use cases . $$ 
They should aim at results and reflect what the system needs to do but not outline how to implement the solution . $$ 
Validation work products inputs to the Technical DM Process take many forms and involve many sources of information . $$ 
Some production and coding can also be separately contracted . $$ 
Validation is conducted by the user operator or by the developer as determined by NASA Center directives or the contract with the developers . $$ {"endOffset":87,"startOffset":82,"label":"Organization"}
The contractor should have its SEMP developed during the proposal process prior to costing and pricing because the SEMP describes the technical content of the project , the potentially costly RM activities , and the V \u0026 V techniques to be used , all of which should be included in the preparation of project cost estimates . $$ 
It is important to identify the critical path and the resources needed to complete the critical tasks along the path if the project is to be completed on time and within its resources . $$ 
From a verification and acceptance point of view , MOPs reflect the system characteristics deemed necessary to achieve the MOEs . $$ 
These may include key decisions made , supporting decision rationale and assumptions , and lessons learned in performing these activities . $$ 
Once established , the sequence should be periodically reviewed to ensure that variations in production and delivery schedules have not had an adverse impact on the sequence or compromised the factors on which earlier decisions were made . $$ 
Functional testing of the assembled or integrated unit is conducted to ensure that assembly is ready to enter verification testing and ready to be integrated into the next level . $$ 
A program defines a strategic direction that the Agency has identified as critical . $$ {"endOffset":56,"startOffset":49,"label":"System Concepts"}
Technical risks are identified in more detail , and technology development needs become focused . $$ 
Off nominal testing as well as nominal testing should be included when planning for validation . $$ 
Requirements allocated to the PBS can be functional requirements what functions need to be performed , performance requirements how well these functions should be performed , and interface requirements product to product $$ 
The technical team needs to review these specifications and ensure they are in a form adequate for the contract or purchase order . $$ 
This includes analyzing the scope of the Definition technical problems to be solved , defining constraints affecting the designs , defining the performance requirements , validating the resulting technical requirement statements , defining the MOPs for each MOE , and defining appropriate TPMs by which technical progress will be assessed . $$ 
SEG is the art and science of developing an operable system capable of meeting requirements within often opposed constraints . $$ {"endOffset":4,"startOffset":0,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
managers to execute the program plan cost effectively . $$ 
Goals address the critical issues identified during the problem assessment . $$ 
On flight projects of long duration , closeout may proceed according to established plans or may begin as a result of unplanned events , such as failures . $$ 
Ensure that required and requested data are appropriately distributed to satisfy the Technical data are provided needs of the acquirer and requesters in accordance with the agreement , program project to authorize requesters in the directives , and technical DM plans and procedures . $$ 
This traceabil ity helps ensure that the team is actually providing what is needed . $$ 
As the purchased products arrive , the technical team should assist in the inspection of the delivered product and its accompanying documentation . $$ 
In the early stages of development , multiple concepts are generated . $$ 
Due to this , the skill mix is normally determined in consultation with people experienced in leading design teams for a particular mission or technical application . $$ 
This includes developing the strategy for technical RM , identifying technical risks , and conducting technical risk assessment ; preparing for technical risk mitigation , monitoring the status of each technical risk , and implementing technical risk mitigation and contingency action plans when applicable thresholds have been triggered . $$ 
Schedule factors may affect the effectiveness and cost values and the risk distributions . $$ 
FCA : Examines the functional characteristics of the configured product and verifies that the product has met , via test results , the requirements specified in its functional baseline documentation approved at the PDR and CDR plus any approved changes thereafter . $$ 
Changes to information under Technical DM do not need a CR but still need to be managed by identifying who can make changes to each type of technical data . $$ {"endOffset":41,"startOffset":29,"label":"Person/People"}
HWIL testing is typically accomplished as a debugging exercise where the hardware and software are brought together for the first time in the costly environment of HWIL . $$ {"endOffset":4,"startOffset":0,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":170,"startOffset":164,"label":"Operation Concepts"}

Recommendation Describe the recommendation that is being made to the decision maker s and the rationale and or Final for why the option was selected . $$ 
The form of the product transitioned is not only a function of the location of that product within the system product hierarchy , but also a function of the life cycle phase . $$ 
CSA reports are updated and maintained throughout the program and project life cycle . $$ {"endOffset":3,"startOffset":0,"label":"System Concepts"}
Each scenario should include events , actions , stimuli , information , and interactions as appropriate to provide a comprehensive understanding of the operational aspects of the system . $$

If this condition is obtained , then it is necessary to consider the value of reducing that uncertainty , and act accordingly . $$ 
Sometimes systems successfully complete verification but then are unsuccessful in some critical phase of the validation process , delaying development and causing extensive rework and possible compromises with the stakeholder . $$

There will almost certainly be alternative ways to decompose functions . $$ {"endOffset":70,"startOffset":51,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Depending on the location within the product layer , the expectation may be traced to an NGO or a requirement of a higher layer product , to organizational strategic plans , or other sources . $$ {"endOffset":93,"startOffset":89,"label":"System Concepts"}

The project plan defines how the project will be managed to achieve its goals and objectives within defined programmatic constraints . $$ 
All require ments should be stated in a fashion and with enough information that it will be possible to verify the requirement after the end product is implemented . $$ 
TA should be done iter atively until requirements and available resources are aligned within an acceptable risk posture . $$ {"endOffset":2,"startOffset":0,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":73,"startOffset":54,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":85,"startOffset":78,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":119,"startOffset":96,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Goal : Goals elaborate on the need and constitute a specific set of expectations for the system . $$ 
Typically , a technical team consists of a mix of both subsystem and discipline engineers . $$ 
Other plans , such as system safety , probabilistic risk assessment , and an HSI Plan also need to be planned for and coordinated with the SEMP . $$ {"endOffset":85,"startOffset":77,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":144,"startOffset":139,"label":"System Concepts"}
This is particularly TRUE in the assessment of the technological maturity of the subsystems and components required for implementation . $$ 
Rationale should be provided where needed to explain why the need , goal , or objective exists , any assumptions made , and any other information useful in understanding or managing the NGO . $$ {"endOffset":189,"startOffset":186,"label":"System Concepts"}
If it can not be accommodated within the established resource margins , then the change most likely should be denied . $$ 
If it is found to be a result of the end product being validated , discussions with the customer should be held and any required system design and product realization process activities should be conducted to resolve deficiencies . $$ 
As each requirement is documented , its bidirectional traceability should be recorded . $$ 
This is a critical point in the design process . $$ 
This could be in the form of fewer instruments , a less ambitious mission profile , accomplishing only a few goals , or using cheaper , less capable technology . $$ 
It describes all the CM activities and the schedule for implementing those activities within the program project . $$ {"endOffset":24,"startOffset":21,"label":"System Concepts"}
Capturing where this information is documented within the SEG or project management Compliance Matrix would be useful for clarity . $$ {"endOffset":62,"startOffset":58,"label":"System Concepts"}
The approved specifications , drawings , parts lists , and other configuration documentation establish the configuration baseline of that product , which may have to be modified at a later time . $$ 
Review PRR or similar systems greater than phase Phase C . $$ {"endOffset":11,"startOffset":7,"label":"System Concepts"}
These agreements should establish the MOEs or MOPs that will be used to monitor the progress of activities . $$ 
Another example would be new hardware developed for space station increments . $$ 
The SEG engine is applied again and again as the system is developed . $$ {"endOffset":8,"startOffset":4,"label":"System Concepts"}
Preparing the packaging for protection , security , and prevention of deterioration is critical for products placed in storage or when it is necessary to transport or ship between and within organizational facilities or between organizations by land , air , and or water vehicles . $$ 
It should identify the critical technologies required to implement the mission and should consider the entire life cycle from fabrication to disposal . $$ 
Managers at each level determine consistent with policies established at the next higher level of the project hierarchy how often and in what form status data should be reported and assessments should be made . $$ 
A MOE is typically qualitative in nature or not able to be used directly as a design to requirement . $$ {"endOffset":6,"startOffset":2,"label":"System Concepts"}
The technical team provides technical work directives to CAMs . $$ 
The processes of the SE engine are used to develop and realize the end products . $$ 
At each level of decomposition , the baselined derived and allocated requirements become the set of high level requirements for the decomposed elements , and the process begins again . $$ 
These procedures establish the interface management responsibilities , what process will be used to maintain and control the internal and external functional and physical interfaces including human , and how the change process will be conducted . $$ 
The Product Integration Process applies not only to hardware and software systems but also to service oriented solutions , requirements , specifications , plans , and concepts . $$ 
Appropriate documentation is also delivered with the end product to the verification process and to the technical DM process . $$ 
Cost is always a limiting factor . $$ 
Assessments of the maturity of the required technology should be done and a technology development plan developed . $$ 
Examples of technical plans in addition to the SEMP are listed in Appendix K . $$ {"endOffset":51,"startOffset":47,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
While the name of each method is the same as the name of the methods for verification , the purpose and intent as described above are quite different . $$ 
By approving a program project , the decision authority commits the budget resources necessary to continue into implementation . $$ 
The purpose of Phase F is to implement the systems decommissioning and disposal planning and analyze any returned data and samples . $$ {"endOffset":22,"startOffset":14,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
All the planning initiated back in Phase A for the testing and operational equipment , processes and analysis , integration of the crosscutting and engineering specialty analysis , and manufacturing processes and controls is implemented . $$ 
Later functions and requirements will be traced to these NGOs . $$ 
To define the project in enough detail to establish an initial baseline capable of meeting mission needs . $$ 
If the answer to any of these questions is no , then changes to the design or stakeholder expectations will be required , and the process is started over again . $$ 
As has been mentioned in previous sections , products can be models and simulations , paper studies or proposals , or hardware and software . $$ {"endOffset":126,"startOffset":117,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":139,"startOffset":131,"label":"System Concepts"}
This may include test fixtures and support equipment . $$ 
During a board meeting to approve a change , actions to update documentation need to be included as part of the change package . $$ 
These solutions should cover the full decision space as defined by the understanding of the decision and definition of the decision criteria . $$ 
Use of a scheduling tool may facilitate the development and maintenance of the schedule . $$ 
The SER also needs to be familiar with the nontechnical aspects of the project . $$ {"endOffset":8,"startOffset":4,"label":"System Concepts"}
If the end user will perform end product validation , sufficient documentation to support end user validation activities is delivered with the end product . $$ 
Output at the agreed to frequency and recipients . $$ 
Each cell for each criterion and each option needs to be completed by the team . $$ 
Analyses of the reserves available versus the needs identified by the threats list assist in the prioritization for reserve use . $$ 
Finally , the availability and skills of personnel needed to conduct the transition as well as the availability of any necessary packaging materials containers , handling equipment , storage facilities , and shipping transporter services should also be reviewed . $$ 
The acceptance test analysis criteria are selected to show that the manufacturing workmanship of the unit conforms to the design that was previously verified qualified . $$ 
These interfaces may include support for assembly , maintenance , and testing functions in addition to the system main performance functions . $$ 
NOTE : In planning for validation , consideration should be given to the extent to which validation testing will be done . $$ 
The ConOps describes how the system will be operated and the possible use case scenarios . $$ 
This serves as a starting point for the overall Technical Planning Process after initial preparation is complete . $$ 
Once the processes , people , and roles and responsibilities are in place , a planning strategy may be formulated for the technical effort . $$ 
Programmatic Requirements : Requirements set by the mission directorate , program , project , and PI , if applicable . $$ {"endOffset":25,"startOffset":0,"label":"System Concepts"}
Approval for Implementation is documented . $$ 
Key Performance Parameter : Those capabilities or characteristics typically engineering based or related to health and safety or operational performance considered most essential for successful mission accomplishment . $$ 
The technical team should also ensure that the approved requirements are communicated in a timely manner to all relevant people . $$ 
Derived Requirements : Requirements arising from constraints , consideration of issues implied but not explicitly stated in the high level direction provided by NASA Headquarters and Center institutional requirements , factors introduced by the selected architecture , and the design . $$ 
Each implementation path has different types of major reviews . $$ 
SERs are heavily involved during this phase in the development and assessment of the architecture and the allocation of requirements to the architecture elements . $$ {"endOffset":5,"startOffset":0,"label":"System Concepts"}
HITL investigations are particularly critical early in the design process to expose , identify , and cost effectively correct operational issues nominal , maintenance , repair , off nominal , training , etc . in the required human interactions with the planned design . $$

RM should be considered in the development of the verification approach . $$ 
In addition , peer reviews play a significant role as a detailed technical component of higher level technical and programmatic reviews . $$ 
The Design Solution Definition Process is used to translate the high level requirements derived from the stakeholder expectations and the outputs of the Logical Decomposition Process into a design solution . $$ {"endOffset":38,"startOffset":4,"label":"System Concepts"}
Protoflight Unit : In projects that will not develop a qualification unit , the flight unit may be designated as a protoflight unit and a limited version of qualification test ranges will be applied . $$ 
In these cases , the Center Director or designee will approve the waiver deviation . $$ {"endOffset":36,"startOffset":21,"label":"Person/People"}
The Technical DM Process is used to capture trade studies , cost estimates , technical analyses , reports , and other important documents not under formal configuration control . $$ {"endOffset":24,"startOffset":4,"label":"System Concepts"}
As the project progresses , stakeholder expectations are flowed down through the Logical Decomposition Process , and specific stakeholders are identified for all of the primary and derived requirements . $$ 
The use of a requirements management tool or model or other application is particularly useful in capturing and tracing expectations and requirements . $$ 
SEG is a holistic , integrative discipline , wherein the contributions of structural engineers , electrical engineers , mechanism designers , power engineers , human factors engineers , and many more disciplines are evaluated and balanced , one against another , to produce a coherent whole that is not dominated by the perspective of a single discipline . $$ {"endOffset":5,"startOffset":0,"label":"System Concepts"}
Cost Risk : This is the risk associated with the ability of the program project to achieve its LCC objectives and secure appropriate funding . $$ 
NASA policy recognizes the need to accommodate the unique aspects of each program or project to achieve mission success in an efficient and economical manner . $$ {"endOffset":5,"startOffset":0,"label":"Organization"}
The Compliance Matrix provides rationales for each of the NPR requirements to assist in understanding . $$ 
It should be realized , however , that this illustration represents neither the project life cycle , which encompasses the system development process from inception through disposal , nor the product development process by which the system design is developed and implemented . $$ 
In this portion of the engine , eight processes provide the crosscutting functions that allow the design solution to be developed , realized , and to operate . $$ 
These documents outline the technical reviews assessment approach as well as identify the technical measures that will be tracked and assessed to determine technical progress . $$ 
For a flight system that returns to Earth after a short mission duration , closeout may require little more than de integrating the hardware and returning it to its owner . $$ 
Deviations and waivers of the requirements can be submitted separately to the Designated Governing Authority or via the Compliance Matrix . $$ 
The CM office should carefully weigh the value of prioritizing resources into CM tools or into $$ 
If a program project decides it does not need one of the required reviews , a waiver or deviation is needed . $$ 
The capture and recording of verification results and related data is a very important , but often underemphasized , step in the Product Verification Process . $$ 
Peer reviews , audits , unit testing , code inspections , simulation checkout , and other techniques may be used to ensure the made or coded product is ready for the verification process . $$ 
Supporting products may be found in product manufacturing plans , processes , and procedures . $$ 
The development of the programmatic and technical management approaches requires that the key project personnel develop an understanding of the work to be performed and the relationships among the various parts of that work . $$

Safety review changes at this point can become costly . $$ 
Given that resources will always be limited , it is necessary to pursue only the most promising technologies that are required to enable a given concept . $$ 
The appropriateness of detail for that documentation depends upon where the product is within the product hierarchy and the life cycle . $$ {"endOffset":134,"startOffset":124,"label":"System Concepts"}
This process continues until the system architec ture , ConOps , and requirements meets the stakeholder expectations . $$ {"endOffset":63,"startOffset":56,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
In this context , time in the schedule is often a critical resource , so that schedule behaves like a kind of cost . $$ 
To reduce risk at constant performance , higher costs must be accepted . $$ 
Scenarios should be described in a manner that allows engineers to walk through them and gain an understanding of how all the various parts of the system should function and interact as well as verify that the system will satisfy the user s goals and expectations MOEs . $$ {"endOffset":269,"startOffset":264,"label":"System Concepts"}
To be more precise , data generally should be processed in some manner to generate useful , actionable information . $$ 
The product to be verified is obtained output from the Product Implementation Process or the Product Integration Process along with any enabling products , such as those representing external interfacing products and support resources including personnel that are necessary for verification . $$ {"endOffset":85,"startOffset":54,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":121,"startOffset":91,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
The savings gained from reuse is not necessarily from reduced acceptance level testing of the flight products , but possibly elimination of the need to fully requalify the item if all elements are the same , including the environment and operation , elimination of the need to specify all of the internal requirements such as printed circuit board specifications or material requirements , reduced internal data products , or the confidence that the item will pass acceptance test and will not require rework . $$ 
In addition to bilateral instruments , contracts include but are not limited to awards and notices of awards ; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements ; letter contracts ; orders , such as purchase orders under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance ; and bilateral contract modifications . $$ 
The requirements should enable the description of all inputs , outputs , and required relationships between inputs and outputs , including constraints , and system interactions with operators , maintainers , and other systems . $$ 
Assemble and integrate the received products into the desired end product in accordance with the specified requirements , configuration documentation , interface requirements , applicable standards , and integration sequencing and procedures . $$ 
Changes to the baseline can affect the consequences and likelihood of identified risk or can introduce new risk to the project . $$ 
As the system matures and progresses through the life cycle , these plans should be updated as necessary to reflect the current environment and resources and to control the project s performance , cost , and schedule . $$ 
This set of stakeholder expectations and high level requirements is used to drive an iterative design loop where a straw man architecture design , the ConOps , and derived requirements are developed . $$ 
Cost and technical problems often show up first as schedule problems . $$ 
In the case of space flight hardware software , it is space . $$ 
The reason may point to a constraint or ConOps . $$ 
The Product Transition Process is the last of the product realization processes , and it is a bridge from one level of the system to the next higher level . $$ 
A verification program may include verifications at several layers in the product hierarchy . $$ 
A well structured validation process can save cost and schedule while meeting the stakeholder expectations . $$ 
Whether extrapolated from historical databases or from interactive planning sessions with the project and stakeholders , realistic values should be calculated and provided to the project team . $$ {"endOffset":119,"startOffset":106,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
LCC : The total of the direct , indirect , recurring , nonrecurring , and other related expenses both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the design , development , verification , production , deployment , prime mission operation , maintenance , support , and disposal of a project , including closeout , but not extended operations . $$ 
This includes preparing to conduct product validation , performing the product validation , analyzing the results of validation including identifying anomalies and establishing recommended corrective actions , and preparing a product validation report providing the evidence of product conformance with the stakeholder expectations baseline . $$ 
This stage can not be accomplished without addressing the roles of operators and maintainers . $$ 
The methodology entails identifying alternatives , one of which should be decided upon ; possible events , one of which occurs thereafter ; and outcomes , each of which results from a combination of decision and event . $$ 
project plan includes all programmatic policies , procedures , standards , and organizational processes that should be adhered to during execution of the technical effort . $$ 
Care should be taken that correcting a deficiency or set of deficiencies does not generate a new issue with a part or performance that had previously operated satisfactorily . $$ 
Data Call : Solicitation from Government stakeholders specifically IPT leads and functional managers identifies and justifies their data requirements from a proposed contracted procurement . $$ 
The SEMP is the primary , top level technical management document for the project and is developed early in the Formulation Phase and updated throughout the project life cycle . $$ {"endOffset":9,"startOffset":4,"label":"System Concepts"}
For example : simulated algorithmic models , virtual reality simulator ; mock up plywood , brassboard , breadboard ; $$ 
MOEs are developed when the NGOs or other stakeholder expectation documentation is developed . $$ {"endOffset":33,"startOffset":28,"label":"Organization"},{"endOffset":5,"startOffset":0,"label":"Person/People"}
This tendency is formalized at some point in Phase B by defining a baseline system definition . $$ {"endOffset":52,"startOffset":45,"label":"System Concepts"}
Once it is understood what the system is to accomplish , it is possible to devise a variety of ways that those goals can be met . $$ 
The plan needs to be adequate to address the specific technical needs of the project . $$ 
Another example is the transition of a software subsystem for integration into a combined hardware software system . $$ 
The Decision Analysis Process should be used to make decisions with respect to needed changes in the verification plans , environment , and or procedures . $$ 
This often comes in the form of NGOs , mission success criteria , and design drivers . $$ {"endOffset":37,"startOffset":32,"label":"Features"}
However , other criteria , such as time to develop and certify a unit , risk , and reliability , also are critical . $$ 
and procedures are on schedule integration , and All open issues should be resolved to support integration . $$ 
To properly classify the project , the team chief engineer , lead SER , SMA , etc . $$ {"endOffset":70,"startOffset":66,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":76,"startOffset":72,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
What can go wrong ? $$ 
The success criteria capture the stakeholder expectations and , along with programmatic requirements and constraints , are used within the high level requirements . $$ 
This validation can be conducted by the receiving organization or by the providing organization if fully documented or witnessed by the receiving representative . $$ 
Flexibility is allowed as to the timing , number , and content of reviews as long as the equivalent ASM Acquisition Strategy Meeting MRR MRR information is provided at each KDP and the approach is fully documented in the Project Plan . $$ {"endOffset":104,"startOffset":100,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":177,"startOffset":173,"label":"System Concepts"}
At each step in the successive refinement of the final design , corresponding integration and verification activities are planned in greater detail . $$ 
Implement the mission operations plan . $$ 
The performance shortfalls may be related to institutional support for mission execution or related to any one or more of the following mission execution domains : safety technical cost schedule $$ 
The system external interface specifications describe the functional baseline for the behavior and characteristics of all physical interfaces that the system has with the external world . $$ 
The basic steps in that process are : $$ 
Mathematical models are useful in this step not only for forcing recognition of the relationships among the outcome variables , but also for helping to determine what the MOPs should be quantitatively . $$ {"endOffset":175,"startOffset":171,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
The mission success criteria for systems differ significantly . $$ 
Requirements traceability is usually recorded in a requirements matrix or through the use of a requirements modeling application . $$ 
However , for systems with several production units , it is important to understand that continuing V \u0026 V is not an appropriate approach to use for the items following the first deliverable . $$ {"endOffset":105,"startOffset":100,"label":"System Concepts"}
This includes preparing or updating a planning strategy for each of the technical processes , and determining deliverable work products from technical efforts ; identifying technical reporting requirements ; identifying entry and success criteria for technical reviews ; identifying product and process measures to be used ; identifying critical technical events ; defining cross domain interoperability and collaboration needs ; defining the DM approach ; identifying the technical risks to be addressed in the planning effort ; identifying tools and engineering methods to be employed ; and defining the approach to acquire and maintain technical expertise needed . $$ {"endOffset":205,"startOffset":173,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":456,"startOffset":443,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":55,"startOffset":38,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":91,"startOffset":72,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":135,"startOffset":110,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":158,"startOffset":141,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":268,"startOffset":252,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":311,"startOffset":295,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":362,"startOffset":346,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":403,"startOffset":374,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":488,"startOffset":473,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":527,"startOffset":512,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":658,"startOffset":639,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":547,"startOffset":542,"label":"Artifact"},{"endOffset":571,"startOffset":552,"label":"Artifact"}
Validated Technical Requirements : This is the approved set of requirements that represents a complete description of the problem to be solved and requirements that have been validated and approved by the customer and stakeholders . $$ {"endOffset":32,"startOffset":0,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Requirement changes during Phases B and C are more likely to cause significant adverse impacts to the project cost and schedule . $$ {"endOffset":35,"startOffset":26,"label":"System Concepts"}
If this activity is not implemented , then the CAMs are often left with insufficient guidance for detailed planning . $$ {"endOffset":51,"startOffset":47,"label":"Artifact"}
The conditions and environment under which the product is to be verified should be established and the verification should be planned based on the associated entrance exit criteria that are identified . $$ 
This customi zation and or tailoring should be documented in the Compliance Matrix and or the review plan or SEMP . $$ {"endOffset":83,"startOffset":65,"label":"Artifact"},{"endOffset":113,"startOffset":109,"label":"Artifact"}
CM reduces technical risks by ensuring correct product configurations , distinguishes among product versions , ensures consistency between the product and information about the product , and avoids the embarrassment cost of stakeholder dissatisfaction and complaint . $$ 
The CM plan may be a standalone document or it may be combined with other program project planning documents . $$ 
A simplified validation asks the questions : Will the system work as expected ? $$ 
It is usually based on the ConOps for the system of interest . $$ 
For science missions , the design drivers include , at a minimum , the mission launch date , duration , and orbit , as well as operational considerations . $$ 
This might include how mission data of interest , such as engineering or scientific data , are captured , returned to Earth , processed , made available to users , and archived for future reference . $$ 
These processes can occur throughout the product life cycle , from concept through disposal . $$ 
The design , test , and production processes process risk influence the technical risk and the nature of the product as depicted in the various levels of the PBS product risk . $$ 
Where EVM is called for , it produces 3 an EVM planning baseline , including a BCWS . $$ 
Determine feasibility of desired system ; develop mission concepts ; draft system level requirements ; assess performance , cost , and schedule feasibility ; identify potential technology needs and scope . $$ 
The plan describes the total T \u0026 E planning from $$ 
Testing can be conducted on final end products , breadboards , brassboards , or prototypes . $$ 
However , if there is a significant change in the project , such as new stakeholder expectations , resource adjustments , or other constraints , all plans should be analyzed for the impact of these changes on the baselined project . $$ 
Proactive iteration with the stakeholders throughout the SEG process is the way that all parties can come to a TRUE understanding of what should be done and what it takes to do the job . $$ 
The IWG may work independently or as a part of a larger change control board . $$ 
Each arrow in the diagram represents one or more data or control flows between two hardware , software , subsystem , or system CI . $$ 
System design and product realization process activities may be required to resolve product nonconformance . $$ 
The Compliance Matrix is attached to the SEMP when submitted for approval . $$ 
Project type , especially for flight projects . $$ 
It instills discipline and keeps the product attributes and documentation consistent . $$ 
Some verifications need to be performed at the lowest component level if the ability to verify a requirement at a higher assembly is not possible . $$ 
The system design processes during Pre Phase A focus on producing a feasible design that will lead to Formulation approval . $$ 
Stakeholders thus find it easier to transfer the product to other parts of their organization , and developers find it easier to transfer it to new stakeholders or reuse it . $$ 
For example , one way of doing architecture is the DOD AF AF . $$ 
This is sometimes pursued as a cost control feature providing motivation for the design contractor to keep the operations costs low and not roll costs into the operations phase of a long term contract . $$ 
Additional planning includes defining and planning for the appropriate technical reviews , audits , assessments , and status reports and determining crosscutting engineering discipline and or design verification requirements . $$ 
The allocated baseline extends the top level performance requirements of the functional baseline to sufficient detail for initiating manufacturing or coding of a CI . $$ 
A basic technical planning strategy should address the following : $$ 
This subsection discusses the process activities , inputs , outcomes , and potential product deficiencies . $$ 
The governing project management directive identifies the required or recommended life cycle for the specific type of program project . $$ 
Reporting requirements and schedule requirements should be established in these agreements . $$ 
The mission success criteria define what the mission needs to accomplish to be successful . $$ 
Contingency planning should be conducted . $$ 
Each function identified is described in terms of inputs , outputs , failure modes , consequence of failure , and interface requirements . $$ 
Thus , when implementing RM on any given program project , the responsible SER should direct the effort accordingly . $$ 
Enabling products : Any other products needed to perform the Product Verification Process . $$ {"endOffset":89,"startOffset":61,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
The methods of validation include test , demonstration , inspection , and analysis . $$ {"endOffset":25,"startOffset":15,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":54,"startOffset":34,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":67,"startOffset":57,"label":"Operation Concepts"},{"endOffset":83,"startOffset":74,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Network scheduling systems help managers accurately assess the impact of both technical and resource changes on the cost and schedule of a project . $$ {"endOffset":26,"startOffset":0,"label":"System Concepts"},{"endOffset":40,"startOffset":31,"label":"Person/People"},{"endOffset":120,"startOffset":115,"label":"Features"},{"endOffset":133,"startOffset":125,"label":"Features"}
It serves as the basis for subsequent definition documents and provides the foundation for the long range operational planning activities . $$ {"endOffset":138,"startOffset":106,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
The capture and recording of validation related data is a very important , but often underemphasized , step in the Product Validation Process . $$ 
Much of the system architecture can be seen even at the outset , so the successive refinements do not correspond exactly to development of the architectural hierarchy either . $$ 
Other work products generated during the transition process are captured and archived as appropriate . $$ 
External : The CM plan is used to communicate the CM process to the contractors involved in the program project . $$ 
Decision criteria are requirements for individually assessing the options and alternatives being considered . $$ 
Internal : It is used within the program project office to guide , monitor , and measure the overall CM process . $$ 
Logical Decomposition Models : These models define the relationship of the requirements and functions and their behaviors . $$ 
It addresses the concepts , properties and characteristics of the system and is represented by entities such as functions , functional flows , interfaces , relationships , resource flow items , physical elements , containers , modes , links , communication resources , etc . $$ 
The constraints typically can not be changed based on tradeoff analyses . $$ 
If there are no product issues , the validation is replanned as necessary , the environment preparation anomalies are corrected , and the validation is conducted again with improved or correct procedures and resources . $$ 
Objectives : Specific target levels of outputs the system must achieve . $$ 
Changes affecting an external interface must be coordinated and approved by all stakeholders affected . $$ 
Breadboard : A low fidelity unit that demonstrates function only , without respect to form or fit in the case of hardware , or platform in the case of software . $$ 
It can involve real or representative input and operational scenarios . $$ 
These measures are MOEs , MOPs , and a special subset of these called TPMs . $$ 
This includes preparing to conduct product transition , Transition evaluating the product and enabling product readiness for product transition , preparing the product for transition including handling , storing , and shipping preparation , preparing sites , and generating required documentation to accompany the product $$ 
When human operators are a critical total system component , the roles and responsibilities of the humans in the system should be clearly understood . $$ 
They also include descriptions of how the end product will be supported throughout the life cycle . $$ 
The type and level of product depends on the phase of the life cycle and the product s specific objectives . $$ {"endOffset":68,"startOffset":58,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
Types of interface documentation include the IRD , Interface Control Document Drawing ICD , IDD , and ICP . $$ 
Timing DRR Disposal Readiness Review PLAR PLAR is notional . $$ 
For example , changes in design and environment could invalidate previous analysis results . $$ 
Once the technical team has defined the technical work to be done , efforts can focus on producing a schedule and cost estimate for the technical portion of the project . $$ 
Typically , an IWG establishes communication links between those responsible for interfacing systems , end products , enabling products , and subsystems . $$ 
The purpose of Phase D is to assemble , integrate , verify , validate , and launch the system . $$ 
All changes need to be routed to the appropriate individuals to ensure that the change has had all impacts identified . $$ 
for a more detailed discussion of TA . $$ 
Phase D : System Assembly , I \u0026 T , Launch . $$ 
Ideally , as wide a range of plausible alternatives as is consistent with the design organization s charter should be defined , keeping in mind the current stage in the process of successive refinement . $$ 
The project manager and SER should work with the verification lead engineer to develop a verification approach and plan the activities . $$ 
The technical team should develop a technical approach that ensures the pro gram project requirements are satisfied and that any technical procedures , processes , and standards to be used in developing the intermediate and final products comply with the policies and processes mandated in the program project plan . $$ 
The planning for the activities should be performed as early as possible since $$ 
This assessment is accomplished through the use of trade studies . $$ 
Demonstrations can involve the use of physical models or mock ups ; for example , a requirement that all controls shall be reachable by the pilot could be verified by having a pilot perform flight related tasks in a cockpit mock up or simulator . $$ 
It provides a set of rules , guidelines , and constraints that defines a cohesive and coherent structure consisting of constituent parts , relationships and connections that establish how those parts fit and work together . $$ 
On a continuing basis , the technical team will identify technical risks including their source , analyze the potential consequence and likelihood of the risks occurring , and prepare clear risk statements for entry into the program project RM system . $$ 
Team Lead Subsystem Lead . $$ 
These activities focus on preparing for the FRR MRR . $$ 
End to end tests performed on the integrated ground and flight assets include all elements of the flight article payload or vehicle , its control , stimulation , communications , and data processing to demonstrate that the entire integrated mission system is operating in a manner to fulfill all mission requirements and objectives . $$ 
The uppermost horizontal portion of this chart is used as a reference to project system maturity , as the project progresses from a feasible concept to an as deployed system ; phase activities ; KDPs ; and major project reviews . $$ 
The entities are not independent but interrelated in the architecture through the relationships between them NASA HQ . $$ 
The SEMP provides the specifics of the technical effort and describes the technical processes that will be used , how the processes will be applied using appropriate activities , how the project will be organized to accomplish the activities , and the cost and schedule associated with accomplishing the activities . $$ {"endOffset":8,"startOffset":4,"label":"Organization"},{"endOffset":93,"startOffset":74,"label":"Operation Concepts"}
The form of the product transitioned will be a function of the product life cycle phase success criteria and the location within the system structure of the WBS model in which the end product exists . $$ 
The operational scenarios describe the dynamic view of the systems operations and include how the system is perceived to function throughout the various modes and mode transitions , including interactions with external interfaces , response to anticipated hazard and faults , and during failure mitigations . $$ 
A recommendation is typically provided from the decision analysis , but is not always required depending on the discretion of the decision making body . $$ 
Effective management of requirements changes requires a process that assesses the impact of the proposed changes prior to approval and implementation of the change . $$ 
Sometimes , that comes about as a consequence of considering alternative functional allocations and integrating available subsystem design options , all of which can have technologies at varying degrees of maturity . $$ 
It is the systematic process of identifying , describing , and relating the functions a system should perform to fulfill its goals and objectives . $$ 
As appropriate , project risk items are updated based on approved verification strategies that can not duplicate fully integrated test systems , configurations , and or target operating environments . $$ 
If probabilistic risk assessment models are applied , it may be necessary to include occurrence rates or probabilities for software faults or human error events . $$ 
For products that the technical team will verify and validate , the product will be ready for verification after ensuring that all work products for this phase have been captured . $$ 
System and subsystem sizes are often determined during the trade studies . $$ 
Testing produces data at discrete points for each specified requirement under controlled conditions and is the most resource intensive verification technique . $$ 
When possible , constraints should also be described by parameters . $$ 
Are the Requirements Redundant or Over specified ? $$ 
This statement describes a high level function that the TVC must perform . $$ 
These advanced studies , along with interactions with customers and other potential stakeholders , help the team to identify promising mission concept s . $$ 
These impacts may manifest themselves in terms of technical , cost , and or schedule . $$ 
Engineering Unit : A high fidelity unit that demonstrates critical aspects of the engineering processes involved in the development of the operational unit . $$ 
Acceptance testing is performed for each flight unit produced . $$ 
Such specifications and other design description documentation establish the configuration baseline of that product , which may have to be modified at a later time . $$ 
In general , NASA adopts the CM principles as defined by SAE EIA 649B , CM Standard , in addition to implementation as defined by NASA CM professionals and as approved by NASA management . $$ 
If a system does not contain software , then none of the NPR requirements for developing and maintaining software would be applicable . $$ 
Iterative : Application of a process to the same product or set of products to correct a discovered discrepancy or other variation from requirements . $$ 
This includes identifying stakeholders , establishing support strategies , Design Expectation establishing a set of MOEs , validating stakeholder Definition \u0026 expectation statements , and obtaining commitments from the customer and other Management stakeholders , as well as using the baselined stakeholder expectations for product validation during product realization $$ 
Ensure that a reused product meets the V \u0026 V required for the relevant system in which it is to be used , as opposed to relying on the original V \u0026 V it met for the system of its original use . $$ 
This activity may be repeated when replanning occurs . $$ 
Product integration is the engineering of the subsystem interactions and their interactions with the system environments both natural and induced . $$ 
But objectives need to be feasible before starting to write requirements and design systems . $$ 
The SEMP should be developed during pre formulation . $$ 
The proposed program s objectives and the concept for meeting those objectives are evaluated . $$ 
These include strategic scientific and exploration requirements , system performance requirements , and schedule , cost , and similar nontechnical constraints . $$ 
Similarly , HITL evaluations identify contingency operational issues . $$ 
The emphasis is on establishing feasibility and desirability rather than optimality . $$ 
Define all interfaces and assign interface authorities and responsibilities to each , both intra and inter organizational . $$ 
This includes decomposing and analyzing by function , time , behavior , data flow , object , and other models . $$ 
Derived Technical Requirements : These are requirements that arise from the definitions of the selected architecture that were not explicitly stated in the baselined requirements that served as an input to this process . $$ 
This is a normal part of project planning wherever there is a need for an accurate planning baseline . $$ 
The PRR determines are approved . $$ {"endOffset":7,"startOffset":4,"label":"Organization"}
